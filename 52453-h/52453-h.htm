      class="pagenum">7</span><a name="link007" id="link007"></a> reader of the
      books of Joseph Conrad it must be at once plain that his immediate
      experiences and impressions of life have gone very directly to the making
      of his art. It may happen often enough that an author&rsquo;s artistic life is
      of no importance to the critic and that his dealing with it is merely a
      personal impertinence and curiosity, but with the life of Joseph Conrad
      the critic has something to do, because, again and again, this writer
      deliberately evokes the power of personal reminiscence, charging it with
      the burden of his philosophy and the creation of his characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the details of his life we cannot, in any way, be concerned, but with
      the three backgrounds against whose form and colour <span class="pagenum">8</span><a
      name="link008" id="link008"></a>his art has been placed we have some
      compulsory connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Conrad (Teodor Josef Konrad Karzeriowski) was born on 6th December
      1857, and his birthplace was the Ukraine in the south of Poland. In 1862
      his father, who had been concerned in the last Polish rebellion, was
      banished to Vologda. The boy lived with his mother and father there until
      his mother died, when he was sent back to the Ukraine. In 1870 his lather
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conrad was then sent to school in Cracow and there he remained until 1874,
      when, following an absolutely compelling impulse, he went to sea. In the
      month of May, 1878, he first landed on English ground; he knew at that
      time no English but learnt rapidly, and in the autumn of 1878 joined the
      <i>Duke of Sutherland</i> as ordinary seaman. He became a Master in the
      English Merchant Service in 1884, in which year he was naturalised. In
      1894 he left the sea, whose servant he had been for nearly twenty years:
      he sent the manuscript of a novel that he had been writing at various
      periods during <span class="pagenum">9</span><a name="link009" id="link009"></a>his
      sea life to Mr Fisher Unwin. With that publisher&rsquo;s acceptance of <i>Almayer&rsquo;s
      Folly</i> the third period of his life began. Since then his history has
      been the history of his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking for an instant at the dramatic contrast and almost ironical
      relationship of these three backgrounds&mdash;Poland, the Sea, the inner
      security and tradition of an English country-side&mdash;one can realise
      what they may make of an artist. That early Polish atmosphere, viewed
      through all the deep light and high shade of a remembered childhood, may
      be enough to give life and vigour to any poet&rsquo;s temperament. The romantic
      melancholy born of early years in such an atmosphere might well plant
      deeply in any soul the ironic contemplation of an impossible freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing into youth in a land whose farthest bounds were held by unlawful
      tyranny, Conrad may well have contemplated the sea as the one unlimited
      monarchy of freedom and, even although he were too young to realise what
      impulses <span class="pagenum">10</span><a name="link010" id="link010"></a>those
      were that drove him, he may have felt that space and size and the force of
      a power stronger than man were the only conditions of possible liberty. He
      sought those conditions, found them and clung to them; he found, too, an
      ironic pity for men who could still live slaves and prisoners to other men
      when to them also such freedom was possible. That ironic pity he never
      afterwards lost, and the romance that was in him received a mighty impulse
      from that contrast that he was always now to contemplate. He discovered
      the Sea and paid to her at once his debt of gratitude and obedience. He
      thought it no hard thing to obey her when he might, at the same time, so
      honestly admire her and she has remained for him, as an artist, the only
      personality that he has been able wholeheartedly to admire. He found in
      her something stronger than man and he must have triumphed in the
      contemplation of the dominion that she could exercise, if she would, over
      the tyrannies that he had known in his childhood. <span class="pagenum">11</span><a
      name="link011" id="link011"></a>He found, too, in her service, the type of
      man who, most strongly, appealed to him. He had known a world composed of
      threats, fugitive rebellions, wild outbursts of defiance, inefficient
      struggles against tyranny, he was in the company now of those who realised
      so completely the relationship of themselves and their duty to their
      master and their service that there was simply nothing to be said about
      it. England had, perhaps, long ago called to him with her promise of
      freedom, and now on an English ship he realised the practice and
      performance of that freedom, indulged in, as it was, with the fewest
      possible words. Moreover, with his fund of romantic imagination, he must
      have been pleased by the contrast of his present company, men who, by
      sheer lack of imagination, ruled and served the most imaginative force in
      nature. The wonders of the sea, by day and by night, were unnoticed by his
      companions, and he admired their lack of vision. Too much vision had
      driven his country under the heel of Tyranny, had bred in himself a
      despair of <span class="pagenum">12</span><a name="link012" id="link012"></a>any
      possible freedom for far-seeing men; now he was a citizen of a world where
      freedom reigned because men could not perceive how it could be otherwise;
      the two sides of the shield were revealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, towards the end of his twenty years&rsquo; service of the sea, the
      creative impulse in him demanded an outlet. He wrote, at stray moments of
      opportunity during several years, a novel, wrote it for his pleasure and
      diversion, sent it finally to a publisher with all that lack of confidence
      in posts and publishers that every author, who cares for his creations,
      will feel to the end of his days. He has said that if <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i>
      had been refused he would never have written again, but we may well
      believe that, let the fate of that book be what it might, the energy and
      surprise of his discovery of the sea must have been declared to the world.
      <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i>, however, was not rejected; its publication caused
      <i>The Spectator</i> to remark: &ldquo;The name of Mr Conrad is new to us, but
      it appears to us as if he might become the Kipling of the Malay
      Archipelago.&rdquo; He <span class="pagenum">13</span><a name="link013"      id="link013"></a>had, therefore, encouragement of the most dignified kind
      from the beginning. He himself, however, may have possibly regarded that
      day in 1897 when Henley accepted <i>The Nigger of the Narcissus</i> for <i>The
      New Review</i> as a more important date in his new career. That date may
      serve for the commencement of the third period of his adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet atmosphere of the England that he had adopted made the final,
      almost inevitable contrast with the earlier periods. With such a country
      behind him it was possible for him to contemplate in peace the whole
      &ldquo;case&rdquo; of his earlier life. It was as a &ldquo;case&rdquo; that he saw it, a &ldquo;case&rdquo;
       that was to produce all those other &ldquo;cases&rdquo; that were his books. This has
      been their history.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      His books, also, find naturally a division into three parts; the first
      period, beginning with <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i> in 1895, ended with <i>Lord
      Jim</i> in 1900. The second contains <span class="pagenum">14</span><a
      name="link014" id="link014"></a>the two volumes of <i>Youth</i> and <i>Typhoon</i>,
      the novel <i>Romance</i> that he wrote in collaboration with Ford Madox
      Hueffer, and ends with <i>Nostromo</i>, published in 1903. The third
      period begins, after a long pause, in 1907 with <i>The Secret Agent</i>,
      and receives its climax with the remarkable popularity of <i>Chance</i> in
      1914, and <i>Victory</i> (1915).
    </p>
    <p>
      His first period was a period of struggle, struggle with a foreign
      language, struggle with a technique that was always, from the point of
      view of the &ldquo;schools,&rdquo; to remain too strong for him, struggles with the
      very force and power of his reminiscences that were urging themselves upon
      him, now at the moment of their contemplated freedom, like wild beasts
      behind iron bars. <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i> and <i>The Outcast of the Islands</i>
      (the first of these is sequel to the second) were remarkable in the
      freshness of their discovery of a new world. It was not that their world
      had not been found before, but rather that Conrad, by the force of his own
      individual discovery, proclaimed his find with a new voice and a new
      vigour. In the <span class="pagenum">15</span><a name="link015"      id="link015"></a>character of Almayer, of Aissa, of Willems, of Bahalatchi
      and Abdulla there was a new psychology that gave promise of great things.
      Nevertheless these early stories were overcharged with atmosphere, were
      clumsy in their development and conveyed in then style a sense of rhetoric
      and lack of ease. His vision of his background was pulled out beyond its
      natural intensity and his own desire to make it overwhelming was so
      obvious as to frighten the creature into a determination to be, simply out
      of malicious perversity, anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two novels were followed by a volume of short stories, <i>Tales of
      Unrest</i>, that reveal, quite nakedly, Conrad&rsquo;s difficulties. One study
      in this book, <i>The Return</i>, with its redundancies and overemphasis,
      is the crudest parody on its author and no single tale in the volume
      succeeds. It was, however, as though, with these efforts, Conrad flung
      himself free, for ever, from his apprenticeship; there appeared in 1898
      what remains perhaps still his most perfect work, <i>The Nigger of the
      Narcissus</i>. This <span class="pagenum">16</span><a name="link016"      id="link016"></a>was a story entirely of the sea, of the voyage of a ship
      from port to port and of the influence upon that ship and upon the human
      souls that she contained, of the approaching shadow of death, an influence
      ironical, melancholy, never quite horrible, and always tender and
      humorous. Conrad must himself have loved, beyond all other vessels, the <i>Narcissus</i>.
      Never again, except perhaps in <i>The Mirror of the Sea</i>, was he to be
      so happily at his ease with any of his subjects. The book is a gallery of
      remarkably distinct and authentic portraits, the atmosphere is held in
      perfect restraint, and the overhanging theme is never, for an instant,
      abandoned. It is, above all, a record of lovingly cherished reminiscence.
      Of cherished reminiscence also was the book that closed the first period
      of his work, <i>Lord Jim</i>. This was to remain, until the publication of
      <i>Chance</i>, his most popular novel. It is the story of a young
      Englishman&rsquo;s loss of honour in a moment of panic and his victorious
      recovery. The first half of the book is a finely sustained development of
      a <span class="pagenum">17</span><a name="link017" id="link017"></a>vividly
      remembered scene, the second half has the inevitability of a moral idea
      pursued to its romantic end rather than the inevitability of life. Here
      then in 1900 Conrad had worked himself free of the underground of the
      jungle and was able to choose his path. His choice was still dictated by
      the subjects that he remembered most vividly, but upon these rewards of
      observation his creative genius was working. James Wait, Donkin, Jim,
      Marlowe were men whom he had known, but men also to whom he had given a
      new birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There appeared now in <i>Youth, Heart of Darkness</i> and <i>Typhoon</i>
      three of the finest short stories in the English language, work of
      reminiscence, but glowing at its heart with all the lyrical exultation and
      flame of a passion that had been the ruling power of a life that was now
      to be abandoned. That salutation of farewell is in <i>Youth</i> and its
      evocation of the East, in <i>The Heart of Darkness</i> and its evocation
      of the forests that are beyond civilisation, in <i>Typhoon</i> and its
      evocation of the sea. He was never, after <span class="pagenum">18</span><a
      name="link018" id="link018"></a>these tales, to write again of the sea as
      though he were still sailing on it. From this time he belonged, with
      regret, and with some ironic contempt, to the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second period closed with the production of a work that was
      deliberately created rather than reminiscent, <i>Nostromo</i>. Conrad may
      have known Dr Monyngham, Decoud, Mrs Could, old Viola; but; they became
      stronger than he and, in their completed personalities, owed no man
      anything for their creation. There is much to be said about <i>Nostromo</i>,
      in many ways the greatest of all Conrad&rsquo;s works, but, for the moment, one
      would only say that its appearance (it appeared first, of all ironical
      births, in a journal&mdash;<i>T.P.&lsquo;s Weekly</i>&mdash;and astonished and
      bewildered its readers week by week, by its determination not to finish
      and yield place to something simpler) caused no comment whatever, that its
      critics did not understand it, and its author&rsquo;s own admirers were puzzled
      by its unlikeness to the earlier sea stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Nostromo</i> was followed by a pause&mdash;one <span class="pagenum">19</span><a
      name="link019" id="link019"></a>can easily imagine that its production
      did, for a moment, utterly exhaust its creator. When, however, in 1907
      appeared <i>The Secret Agent</i>, a new attitude was most plainly visible.
      He was suddenly detached, writing now of &ldquo;cases&rdquo; that interested him as an
      investigator of human life, but called from his heart no burning
      participation of experience. He is tender towards Winnie Verloc and her
      old mother, the two women in <i>The Secret Agent</i>, but he studies them
      quite dispassionately. That love that clothed Jim so radiantly, that
      fierce contempt that in <i>An Outcast of the Islands</i> accompanied
      Willems to his degraded death, is gone. We have the finer artist, but we
      have lost something of that earlier compelling interest. <i>The Secret
      Agent</i> is a tale of secret service in London; it contains the
      wonderfully created figure of Verloc and it expresses, to the full,
      Conrad&rsquo;s hatred of those rows and rows of bricks and mortar that are so
      completely accepted by unimaginative men. In 1911 <i>Under Western Eyes</i>
      spoke strongly of a Russian influence <span class="pagenum">20</span><a
      name="link020" id="link020"></a>Turgéniev and Dostoievsky had too markedly
      their share in the creation of Razumov and the cosmopolitan circle in
      Geneva. Moreover, it is a book whose heart is cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      A volume of short stories, <i>A Set of Six</i>, illustrating still more
      emphatically Conrad&rsquo;s new detachment, appeared in 1908 and is remarkable
      chiefly for an ironically humorous story of the Napoleonic wars&mdash;<i>The
      Duel</i>&mdash;a tale too long, perhaps, but admirable for its sustained
      note. In 1912 he seemed, in another volume, <i>&lsquo;Twixt Land and Sea</i>, to
      unite some of his earlier glow with all his later mastery of his method.
      <i>A Smile, of Fortune</i> and <i>The Secret Sharer</i> are amazing in the
      beauty of retrospect that they leave behind them in the soul of the
      reader. The sea is once more revealed to us, but it is revealed now as
      something that Conrad has conquered. His contact with the land has taken
      from him something of his earlier intimacy with his old mistress.
      Nevertheless <i>The Secret Sharer</i> is a most marvellous story,
      marvellous in its completeness of theme and treatment, marvellous in the
      <span class="pagenum">21</span><a name="link021" id="link021"></a>contrast
      between the confined limitations of its stage and the vast implications of
      its moral idea. Finally in 1914 appeared <i>Chance</i>, by no means the
      finest of his books, but catching the attention and admiration of that
      wider audience who had remained indifferent to the force and beauty of <i>The
      Nigger of the Narcissus</i>, of <i>Lord Jim</i>, of <i>Nostromo</i>. With
      the popular success of <i>Chance</i> the first period of his work is
      closed. On the possible results of that popularity, their effect on the
      artist and on the whole world of men, one must offer, here at any rate, no
      prophecy.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      To any reader who cares, seriously, to study the art of Joseph Conrad, no
      better advice could be offered than that he should begin with the reading
      of the two volumes that have been omitted from the preceding list. <i>Some
      Reminiscences</i> and <i>The Mirror of the Sea</i> demand consideration on
      the threshold of any survey of this author&rsquo;s work, because <span
      class="pagenum">22</span><a name="link022" id="link022"></a>they reveal,
      from a personal, wilful and completely anarchistic angle, the
      individuality that can only be discovered, afterwards, objectively, in the
      process of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both these books Conrad is, quite simply, himself for anyone who cares
      to read. They are books dictated by no sense of precedent nor form nor
      fashion. They are books of their own kind, even more than are the novels.
      <i>Some Reminiscences</i> has only <i>Tristram Shandy</i> for its rival in
      the business of getting everything done without moving a step forward. <i>The
      Mirror of the Sea</i> has no rival at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may suppose that the author did really intend to write his
      reminiscences when he began. He found a moment that would make, a good
      starting-point, a moment in the writing of his first book, <i>Almayer&rsquo;s
      Folly</i>, at the conclusion or, more truly, cessation of <i>Some
      Reminiscences</i>, that moment is still hanging in mid-air, the writing of
      <i>Almayer</i> has not proceeded two lines farther down the stage, the
      maid-servant, is still standing in the doorway, the hands of <span
      class="pagenum">23</span><a name="link023" id="link023"></a>the clock have
      covered five minutes of the dial. What has occurred is simply that the
      fascination of the subject has been too strong. It is of the very essence
      of Conrad&rsquo;s art that one thing so powerfully suggests to him another that
      to start him on anything at all is a tragedy, because life is so short.
      His reminiscences would be easy enough to command would they only not take
      on a life of their own and shout at their unfortunate author: &ldquo;Ah! yes.
      I&rsquo;m interesting, of course, but don&rsquo;t you remember...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole adventure of writing his first book is crowded with incident,
      not because he considers it a wonderful book or himself a marvellous
      figure, but simply because any incident in the world must, in his eyes, be
      crowded about with other incidents. There is the pen one wrote the book
      with, that pen that belonged to poor old Captain B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      of the <i>Nonsuch</i> who... or there is the window just behind the
      writing-table that looked out into the river, that river that reminds one
      of the year &lsquo;88 when...
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of his thrilling voyage of <span class="pagenum">24</span><a
      name="link024" id="link024"></a>discovery we are, by a kind of most
      blessed miracle, told something of Mr Nicholas B. and of the author&rsquo;s own
      most fascinating uncle. We even, by an extension of the miracle, learn
      something of Conrad as ship&rsquo;s officer (this the merest glimpse) and as a
      visitor to his uncle&rsquo;s house in Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      So by chance are these miraculous facts and glimpses that we catch at them
      with eager, extended hands, praying, imploring them to stay; indeed those
      glimpses may seem to us the more wonderful in that they have been, by us,
      only partially realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, in spite of its eager incoherence, at the same time both
      breathless, and, by the virtue of its author&rsquo;s style, solemn, we do
      obtain, in addition to our glimpses of Poland and the sea, one or two
      revelations of Conrad himself. Our revelations come to us partly through
      our impression of his own zest for life, a zest always ironical, often
      sceptical, but always eager and driven by a throbbing impulse of vitality.
      Partly also through certain deliberate utterances. He tells us: <span
      class="pagenum">25</span><a name="link025" id="link025"></a>"Those who
      read me know my conviction that the world, the temporal world, rests on a
      few very simple ideas; so simple that they must be as old as the hills. It
      rests, notably, amongst others, on the idea of Fidelity. At a time when
      nothing which is not revolutionary in some way or other can expect to
      attract much attention I have not been revolutionary in my writings.&rdquo;
       (Page 20.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Or again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All claim to special righteousness awakens in me that scorn and anger
      from which a philosophical mind should be free.&rdquo; (Page 21.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Or again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even before the most seductive reveries I have remained mindful of that
      sobriety of interior life, that asceticism of sentiment, in which alone
      the naked form of truth, such as one conceives it, such as one feels it,
      can be rendered without shame.&rdquo; (Page 194.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This simplicity, this fidelity, this hatred of self-assertion and
      self-satisfaction, this sobriety&mdash;these qualities do give some
      implication of the colour of the work that will <span class="pagenum">26</span><a
      name="link026" id="link026"></a>arise from them; and when to these
      qualities we add that before-mentioned zest and vigour we must have some
      true conception of the nature of the work that he was to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is for this that <i>Some Reminiscences</i> is valuable. To read it as a
      detached work, to expect from it the amiable facetiousness of a book of
      modern memories or the heavy authoritative coherence of the <i>My
      Autobiography</i> or <i>My Life</i> of some eminent scientist or
      theologian, is to be most grievously disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the beginning is bewilderment the end is an impression of crowding,
      disordered life, of a tapestry richly dark, with figures woven into the
      very thread of it and yet starting to life with an individuality all their
      own. No book reveals more clearly the reasons both of Conrad&rsquo;s faults and
      of his merits. No book of his is more likely by reason of its honesty and
      simplicity to win him true friends. As a work of art there is almost
      everything to be said against it, except that it has that supreme gift
      that remains, at the end, almost all that we ask of any work of <span
      class="pagenum">27</span><a name="link027" id="link027"></a>art,
      overwhelming vitality. But it is formless, ragged, incoherent,
      inconclusive, a fragment of eager, vivid, turbulent reminiscence poured
      into a friend&rsquo;s ear in a moment of sudden confidence. That may or may not
      be the best way to conduct reminiscences; the book remains a supremely
      intimate, engaging and enlightening introduction to its author.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <i>The Mirror of the Sea</i> we are on very different ground. As I
      have already said, this is Conrad&rsquo;s happiest book&mdash;indeed, with the
      possible exception of <i>The Nigger of the Narcissus</i>, his only happy
      book. He is happy because he is able, for a moment, to forget his
      distrust, his dread, his inherent ironical pessimism. He is here
      permitting himself the whole range of his enthusiasm and admiration, and
      behind that enthusiasm there is a quiet, sure confidence that is strangely
      at variance with the distrust of his later novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book seems at first sight to be a collection of almost haphazard
      papers, with such titles as <i>Landfalls and Departures</i>, <span
      class="pagenum">28</span><a name="link028" id="link028"></a><i>Overdue and
      Missing, Rulers of East and West, The Nursery of the Craft</i>. No reader
      however, can conclude it without having conveyed to him a strangely
      binding impression of Unity. He has been led, it will seem to him, mto the
      very heart of the company of those who know the Sea as she really is, he
      has been made free of a great order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foundation of his intimacy springs from three sources&mdash;the
      majesty, power and cruelty of the Sea herself, the homely reality of the
      lives of the men who serve her, the vibrating, beautiful life of the ships
      that sail upon her. This is the Trilogy that holds in its hands the whole
      life and pageant of the sea; it is because Conrad holds all three elements
      in exact and perfect balance that this book has its unique value, its
      power both of realism, for this is the life of man, and of romance, which
      is the life of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conrad&rsquo;s attitude to the Sea herself, in this book, is one of lyrical and
      passionate worship. He sees, with all the vivid accuracy of his realism,
      her deceits, her <span class="pagenum">29</span><a name="link029"      id="link029"></a>cruelties, her inhuman disregard of the lives of men,
      but, finally, her glory is enough for him. He will write of her like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sea&mdash;this truth must be confessed&mdash;has no generosity. No
      display of manly qualities&mdash;courage, hardihood, endurance,
      faithfulness&mdash;has ever been known to touch its irresponsible
      consciousness of power. The ocean has the conscienceless temper of a
      savage autocrat spoiled by much adulation. He cannot brook the slightest
      appearance of defiance, and has remained the irreconcilable enemy of ships
      and men ever since ships and men had the unheard-of audacity to go afloat
      together in the face of his frown... the most amazing wonder of the deep
      is its unfathomable cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she holds him her most willing slave and he is that because
      he believes that she alone in all the world is worthy to indulge this
      cruelty. She positively &ldquo;brings it off,&rdquo; this assertion of her right, and
      once he is assured of that, he will yield absolute obedience. In this
      worship of the Sea and the winds that rouse her he allows himself a <span
      class="pagenum">30</span><a name="link030" id="link030"></a>lyrical
      freedom that he was afterwards to check. He was never again, not even in
      <i>Typhoon</i> and <i>Youth</i>, to write with such free and spontaneous
      lyricism as in his famous passage about the &ldquo;West Wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Mirror of the Sea</i> forms then the best possible introduction to
      Conrad&rsquo;s work, because it attests, more magnificently and more confidently
      than anything else that he has written, his faith and his devotion. It
      presents also, however, in its treatment of the second element of his
      subject, the men on the ships, many early sketches of the characters whom
      he, both before and afterwards, developed so fully in his novels. About
      these same men there are certain characteristics to be noticed,
      characteristics that must be treated more fully in a later analysis of
      Conrad&rsquo;s creative power, but that nevertheless demand some mention here as
      witnesses of the emotions, the humours, the passions that he, most
      naturally, observes. It is, in the first place, to be marked that almost
      all the men upon the sea, from &ldquo;poor Captain B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      who used <span class="pagenum">31</span><a name="link031" id="link031"></a>to
      suffer from sick headaches, in his young days, every time he was
      approaching a coast,&rdquo; to the dramatic Dominic (&ldquo;from the slow,
      imperturbable gravity of that broad-chested man you would think he had
      never smiled in his life&rdquo;), are silent and thoughtful. Granted this
      silence, Conrad in his half-mournful, half-humorous survey, is instantly
      attracted by any possible contrast. Captain B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- dying
      in his home, with two grave, elderly women sitting beside him in the quiet
      room, &ldquo;his eyes resting fondly upon the faces in the room, upon the
      pictures on the wall, upon all the familiar objects of that home whose
      abiding and clear image must have flashed often on his memory in times of
      stress and anxiety at sea&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;poor P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;
       with &ldquo;his cheery temper, his admiration for the jokes in <i>Punch</i>, his
      little oddities&mdash;like his strange passion for borrowing
      looking-glasses, for instance&rdquo;&mdash;that captain who &ldquo;did everything with
      an air which put your attention on the alert and raised your expectations,
      but the result somehow was always on stereotyped <span class="pagenum">32</span><a
      name="link032" id="link032"></a>lines, unsuggestive, empty of any lesson
      that one could lay to heart&rdquo;&mdash;that other captain in whom &ldquo;through a
      touch of self-seeking that modest artist of solid merit became untrue to
      his temperament&rdquo;&mdash;here are little sketches for those portraits that
      afterwards we are to know so well, Marlowe, Captain M&rsquo;Whirr, Captain
      Lingard, Captain Mitchell and many others. Here we may fancy that his eye
      lingers as though in the mere enumeration of little oddities and
      contrasted qualities he sees such themes, such subjects, such &ldquo;cases&rdquo; that
      it is hard, almost beyond discipline, to leave them. Nevertheless they
      have to be left. He has obtained his broader contrast by his juxtaposition
      of the curious muddled jumble of the human life against the broad, august
      power of the Sea&mdash;that is all that his present subject demands, that
      is his theme and his picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all his theme, however; there remains the third element in it, the
      soul of the ship. It is, perhaps, after all, with the life of the ship
      that <i>The Mirror of The Sea</i>, ultimately, has most to do. <span
      class="pagenum">33</span><a name="link033" id="link033"></a>As other men
      write of the woman they have loved, so does Conrad write of his ships. He
      sees them, in this book that is so especially dedicated to their pride and
      beauty, coloured with a fine glow of romance, but nevertheless he realises
      them with all the accurate detail of a technician who describes his craft.
      You may learn of the raising and letting go of an anchor, and he will tell
      the journalists of their crime in speaking of &ldquo;casting&rdquo; an anchor when the
      true technicality is &ldquo;brought up&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to an anchor&rdquo; understood. In the
      chapter on &ldquo;Yachts&rdquo; he provides as much technical detail as any book of
      instruction need demand and then suddenly there come these sentences&mdash;&ldquo;the
      art of handling slips is finer, perhaps, than the art of handling men.&rdquo;...
      &ldquo;A ship is a creature which we have brought into the world, as it were on
      purpose to keep us up to mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed it is the ship that gives that final impression of unity, of which
      I have already spoken, to the book. She grows, as it were, from her birth,
      in no ordered sequence of <span class="pagenum">34</span><a name="link034"      id="link034"></a>events, but admitting us ever more closely into her
      intimacy, telling us, at first shyly, afterwards more boldly, little
      things about herself, confiding to us her trials, appealing sometimes to
      our admiration, indulging sometimes our humour. Conrad is tender to her as
      he is to nothing human. He watches her shy, new, in the dock, &ldquo;her
      reputation all to make yet in the talk of the seamen who were to share
      their life with her.&rdquo;... &ldquo;She looked modest to me. I imagined her
      diffident, lying very quiet, with her side nestling shyly against the
      wharf to which she was made fast with very new lines, intimidated by the
      company of her tried and experienced bisters already familiar with all the
      violences of the ocean and the exacting love of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her friend stands there on the quay and bids her be of good courage; he
      salutes her grace and spirit&mdash;he echoes, with all the implied irony
      of contrast, his companion&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ships are all right....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He explains the many kinds of ships that there are&mdash;the rogues, the
      wickedly malicious, <span class="pagenum">35</span><a name="link035"      id="link035"></a>the sly, the benevolent, the proud, the adventurous, the
      staid, the decorous. For even the worst of these he has indulgences that
      he would never offer to the soul of man. He cannot be severe before such a
      world of fine spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in the episode of the <i>Tremolino</i> and her tragic end (an end
      that has in it a suggestion of that later story, <i>Freya of the Seven
      Inlands</i>), in that sinister adventure of Dominic and the vile Caesar,
      he shows us, in miniature, what it is that he intends to do with all this
      material. He gives us the soul of the <i>Tremolino</i>, the soul of
      Dominic, the soul of the sea upon which they are voyaging. Without ever
      deserting the realism upon which he builds his foundations he raises upon
      it his house of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book remains by far the easiest, the kindest, the most friendly of
      all his books. He has been troubled here by no questions of form, of
      creation, of development, whether of character or of incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the best of all possible prologues to his more creative work.

      II&mdash;THE NOVELIST
    </h2>
    <h3>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N <span
      class="pagenum">36</span><a name="link036" id="link036"></a>discussing the
      art of any novelist as distinct from the poet or essayist there are three
      special questions that we may ask&mdash;as to the Theme, as to the Form,
      as to the creation of Character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to discuss these three questions in terms that can be
      applied, in no fashion whatever, to the poem or the essay, although the
      novel may often more truly belong to the essay or the poem to the novel,
      as, for instance, <i>The Ring and the Book</i> and <i>Aurora Leigh</i>
      bear witness. All such questions of ultimate classes and divisions are
      vain, but these three divisions of Theme, Form and Character do cover many
      of the questions that are to be asked about any novelist simply in his
      position as novelist <span class="pagenum">37</span><a name="link037"      id="link037"></a>and nothing else. That Joseph Conrad is, in his art, most
      truly poet as well as novelist no reader of his work will deny. I wish, in
      this chapter, to consider him simply as a novelist&mdash;that is, as a
      narrator of the histories of certain human beings, with his attitude to
      those histories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the form of the novel the English novelists, until the
      seventies and eighties of the nineteenth century, worried themselves but
      slightly. If they considered the matter they chuckled over their
      deliberate freedom, as did Sterne and Fielding. Scott considered
      story-telling a jolly business in which one was, also, happily able to
      make a fine living, but he never contemplated the matter with any respect.
      Jane Austen, who had as much form as any modern novelist, was quite
      unaware of her happy possession. The mid-Victorians gloriously abandoned
      themselves to the rich independence of shilling numbers, a fashion which
      forbade Form as completely as the manners of the time forbade frankness. A
      new period began at the end of the fifties; <span class="pagenum">38</span><a
      name="link038" id="link038"></a>but no one in 1861 was aware that a novel
      called <i>Evan Harrington</i> was of any special importance; it made no
      more stir than did <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i> in the early nineties, although
      the wonderful <i>Richard Feverel</i> had already preceded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the coming of George Meredith and Thomas Hardy the Form of the novel,
      springing straight from the shores of France, where <i>Madame Bovary</i>
      and <i>Une Vie</i> showed what might be done by taking trouble, grew into
      a question of considerable import. Robert Louis Stevenson showed how
      important it was to say things agreeably, even when you had not very much
      to say. Henry James showed that there was so much to say about everything
      that you could not possibly get to the end of it, and Rudyard Kipling
      showed that the great thing was to see things as they were. At the
      beginning of the nineties everyone was immensely busied over the way that
      things were done. <i>The Yellow Book</i> sprang into a bright existence,
      flamed, and died. &ldquo;Art for Art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; was slain by the trial of Oscar
      Wilde in 1895.

      Wells, in addition to fantastic romances, wrote stories about shop
      assistants and knew something about biology. The Fabian Society made
      socialism entertaining. Mr Bernard Shaw foreshadowed a new period and the
      Boer War completed an old one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the whole question of Conrad&rsquo;s place in the history of the English
      novel and his influence upon it I wish to speak in a later chapter. I
      would simply say here that if he was borne in upon the wind of the French
      influence he was himself, in later years, one of the chief agents in its
      destruction, but, beginning to write in English as he did in the time of
      <i>The Yellow Book</i>, passing through all the realistic reaction that
      followed the collapse of aestheticism, seeing the old period washed away
      by the storm of the Boer War, he had, especially prepared for him, a new
      stage upon which to labour. The time and the season were ideal for the
      work that he had to do.

      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">40</span><a name="link040" id="link040"></a>The form
      in which Conrad has chosen to develop his narratives is the question which
      must always come first in any consideration of him as a novelist; the
      question of his form is the ground upon which he has been most frequently
      attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His difficulties in this matter have all arisen, as I have already
      suggested, from his absorbing interest in life. Let us imagine, for an
      instant, an imaginary case. He has teen in some foreign port a quarrel
      between two seamen. One has &ldquo;knifed&rdquo; the other, and the quarrel has been
      watched, with complete indifference, by a young girl and a bibulous old
      wastrel who is obviously a relation both of hers and of the stricken
      seaman. The author sees here a case for his art and, wishing to give us
      the matter with the greatest possible truth and accuracy, he begins, <i>oratio
      recta</i>, by the narration of a little barber whose shop is just over the
      spot where the quarrel took place and whose lodgers the old man and the
      girl are. He <span class="pagenum">41</span><a name="link041" id="link041"></a>describes
      the little barber and is, at once, amazed by the interesting facts that he
      discovers about the man. Seen standing in his doorway he is the most
      ordinary little figure, but once investigate his case and you find a
      strange contrast between his melancholy romanticism and the flashing
      fanaticism of his love for the young girl who lodges with him. That leads
      one back, through many years, to the moment of his first meeting with the
      bibulous old man, and for a witness of that wo must hunt out a villainous
      old woman who keeps a drinking saloon in another part of the town. This
      old woman, now so drink-sodden and degraded, had once a history of her
      own. Once she was...
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the matter continues. It is not so much a deliberate evocation of
      the most difficult of methods, this maimer of narration, as a poignant
      witness to Conrad&rsquo;s own breathless surprise at his discoveries. Mr Henry
      James, speaking of this enforced collection of oratorical witnesses, says:
      &ldquo;It places Mr Conrad absolutely alone as a <span class="pagenum">42</span><a
      name="link042" id="link042"></a>votary of the way to do a thing that shall
      make it undergo most doing,&rdquo; and his amazement at Conrad&rsquo;s patient pursuit
      of unneeded difficulties may seem to us the stranger if we consider that
      in <i>What Maisie Knew</i> and <i>The Awkward Age</i> he has practised
      almost precisely the same form himself. Indeed beside the intricate but
      masterly form of <i>The Awkward Age</i> the duplicate narration of <i>Chance</i>
      seems child&rsquo;s play. Mr Henry James makes the mistake of speaking as though
      Conrad had quite deliberately chosen the form of narration that was most
      difficult to him, simply for the fun of overcoming the difficulties, the
      truth being that he has chosen the easiest, the form of narration brought
      straight from the sea and the ships that he adored, the form of narration
      used by the Ancient Mariner and all the seamen before and alter him.
      Conrad must have his direct narrator, because that is the way in which
      stories in the past had generally come to him. He wishes to deny the
      effect of that direct and simple honesty that had always seemed so
      attractive to <span class="pagenum">43</span><a name="link043" id="link043"></a>him.
      He must have it by word of mouth, because it is by word of mouth that he
      himself has always demanded it, and if one witness is not enough for the
      truth of it then must he have two or three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider for a moment the form of three of his most important novels: <i>Lord
      Jim, Nostromo</i> and <i>Chance</i>. It is possible that <i>Lord Jim</i>
      was conceived originally as a sketch of character, derived by the author
      from one scene that was, in all probability, an actual reminiscence.
      Certainly, when the book is finished, one scene beyond all others remains
      with the reader; the scene of the inquiry into the loss of the <i>Patna</i>,
      or rather the vision of Jim and his appalling companions waiting outside
      for the inquiry to begin. Simply in the contemplation of these four men
      Conrad has his desired contrast; the skipper of the <i>Patna</i>: &ldquo;He made
      me think of a trained baby elephant walking on hind-legs. He was
      extravagantly gorgeous too&mdash;got up in a. soiled sleeping-suit, bright
      green and deep orange vertical stripes, with a pair of ragged straw
      slippers <span class="pagenum">44</span><a name="link044" id="link044"></a>on
      his bare feet, and somebody&rsquo;s cast-off pith hat, very dirty and two sizes
      too small for him, tied up with a manilla rope-yarn on the top of his big
      head.&rdquo; There are also two other &ldquo;no-account chaps with him&rdquo;&mdash;a sallow
      faced mean little chap with his arm in a sling, and a long individual in a
      blue flannel coat, as dry as a chip and no stouter than a broomstick, with
      drooping grey moustaches, who looked about him with an air of jaunty
      imbecility, and, with these three, Jim, &ldquo;clean-limbed, clean-faced, firm
      on his feet, as promising a boy as the sun ever shone on.&rdquo; Here are these
      four, in the same box, condemned for ever by all right-thinking men. That
      boy in the same box as those obscene scoundrels! At once the artist has
      fastened on to his subject, it bristles with active, vital possibilities
      and discoveries. We, the observers, share the artist&rsquo;s thrill. We watch
      our author dart upon a subject with the excitement of adventurers
      discovering a gold mine. How much will it yield? How deep will it go? We
      are thrilled with the suspense. <span class="pagenum">45</span><a
      name="link045" id="link045"></a>Conrad, having discovered his subject,
      must, for the satisfaction of that honour which is his most deeply
      cherished virtue, prove to us his authenticity. &ldquo;I was not there myself,&rdquo;
       he tells us, &ldquo;but I can show you someone who was.&rdquo; He introduces us to a
      first-hand witness, Marlowe or another. &ldquo;Now tell your story.&rdquo; He has at
      once the atmosphere in which he is happiest, and so, having his audience
      clustered about him, unlimited time at everyone&rsquo;s disposal, whiskies and
      cigars without stint, he lets himself go. He is bothered now by no
      question but the thorough investigation of his discovery. What had Jim
      done that he should be in such a case? We must have the story of the loss
      of the <i>Patna</i>, that marvellous journey across the waters, all the
      world of the pilgrims, the obscene captain and Jim&rsquo;s fine, chivalrous
      soul. Marlowe is inexhaustible. He has so much to say and so many fine
      words in which to say it. At present, so absorbed are we, so successful is
      he, that we are completely held. The illusion is perfect. We come to the
      inquiry. <span class="pagenum">46</span><a name="link046" id="link046"></a>One
      of the judges is Captain Brierley. &ldquo;What! not know Captain Brierley! Ah!
      but I must tell you! Most extraordinary thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The world grows around us; a world that can contain the captain of the <i>Patna</i>,
      Brierley and Jim at the same time! The subject before us seems now so rich
      that we are expecting to see it burst, at any moment, in the author&rsquo;s
      hands, but so long as that first visualised scene is the centre of the
      episode, so long as the experience hovers round that inquiry and the
      Esplanade outside it, we are held, breathless and believing. We believe
      even in the eloquent Marlowe. Then the moment passes. Every possible probe
      into its heart has been made. We are satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There follows then the sequel, and here at once the weakness of the method
      is apparent. The author having created his narrator must continue with
      him. Marlowe is there, untired, eager, waiting to begin again. But the
      trouble is that we are do longer assured now of the truth and <span
      class="pagenum">47</span><a name="link047" id="link047"></a>reality of his
      story. He saw&mdash;we cannot for an instant doubt it&mdash;that group on
      the Esplanade; all that he could tell us about that we, breathlessly,
      awaited. But now we are uncertain whether he is not inventing a romantic
      sequel. He must go on&mdash;that is the truly terrible thing about Marlowe&mdash;and
      at the moment when we question his authenticity we are suspicious of his
      very existence, ready to be irritated by his flow of words demanding
      something more authentic than that voice that is now only dimly heard. The
      author himself perhaps feels this; he duplicates, he even trebles his
      narrators and with each fresh agent raises a fresh crop of facts,
      contrasts, halts and histories. That then is the peril of the method.
      Whilst we believe we are completely held, but let the authenticity waver
      for a moment and the danger of disaster is more excessive than with any
      other possible form of narration. Create your authority and we have at
      once someone at whom we may throw stones if we are not beguiled, Marlowe
      has certainly been compelled to <span class="pagenum">48</span><a
      name="link048" id="link048"></a>face, at moments in his career, an angry,
      irritated audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Nostromo</i> is, for the reason that we never lose our confidence in
      the narrator, a triumphant vindication of these methods. That is not to
      deny that <i>Nostromo</i> is extremely contused in places, but it is a
      confusion that arises rather from Conrad&rsquo;s confidence in the reader&rsquo;s
      fore-knowledge of the facts than in a complication of narrations. The
      narrations are sometimes complicated&mdash;old Captain Mitchell does not
      always achieve authenticity&mdash;but on the whole, the reader may be said
      to be puzzled, simply because he is told so much about some things and so
      little about others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this assurance of the author&rsquo;s that we must have already learnt the
      main facts of the case comes from his own convinced sense of the reality
      of it. This time he has no Marlowe. He was there himself. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he
      says to us, &ldquo;you know all about that revolution in Sulaco, that revolution
      that the Goulds were mixed up with. Well, I happened to be there myself. I
      know all <span class="pagenum">49</span><a name="link049" id="link049"></a>the
      people concerned, and the central figure was not Gould, nor Mitchell, nor
      Monyngham&mdash;no, it was a man about whom no one outside the republic
      was told a syllable. I knew the man well.... He.. and there we all are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The method is, in this case, as I have already said, completely
      successful. There may be confusions, there may be scenes concerning which
      we may be expected to be told much and are, in truth, told nothing at all,
      but these confusions and omissions do, in the end, only add to our
      conviction of the veracity of it. No one, after a faithful perusal of <i>Nostromo</i>,
      can possibly doubt of the existence of Sulaco, of the silver mine, of
      Nostromo and Decoud, of Mrs Gould, Antonio, the Viola girls, of old Viola,
      Hirsch, Monyngham, Gould, Sotillo, of the death of Viola&rsquo;s wife, of the
      expedition at night in the painter, of Decoud alone on the Isabels, of
      Hirsch&rsquo;s torture, of Captain Mitchell&rsquo;s watch&mdash;here are characters
      the most romantic in the world, scenes that would surely, in any other
      hands, be fantastic <span class="pagenum">50</span><a name="link050"      id="link050"></a>melodrama, and both characters and scenes are absolutely
      supported on the foundation of realistic truth. Not for a moment from the
      first page to the last do we consciously doubt the author&rsquo;s word.... Here
      the form of narration is vindicated because it is entirely convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so with the third example, <i>Chance</i>. Here, as with <i>Lord Jim</i>,
      we may find one, visualised moment that stands for the whole book and as
      in the earlier work we look back and see the degraded officers of the <i>Patna</i>
      waiting with Jim on the Esplanade, so our glance back over <i>Chance</i>
      reveals to us that moment when the Fynes, from the security of their
      comfortable home, watch Flora de Barrel flying down the steps of her
      horrible Brighton house as though the Furies pursued her. That desperate
      flight is the key of the book. The moment of the chivalrous Captain
      Anthony&rsquo;s rescue of Flora from a world too villainous for her and too
      double-faced for him gives the book&rsquo;s theme, and never in all the stories
      that preceded Flora&rsquo;s has Conrad been so <span class="pagenum">51</span><a
      name="link051" id="link051"></a>eager to afford us first-hand witnesses.
      We have, in the first place, the unquenchable Marlowe sitting, with fine
      phrases at his lips, in a riverside inn. To him enter Powell, who once
      served with Captain Anthony; to these two add the little Fynes; there
      surely you have enough to secure your alliance. But it is precisely the
      number of witnesses that frightens us. Marlowe, unaided, would have been
      enough for us, more than enough if we are to consider the author himself
      as a possible narrator. But not only does the number frighten us, it
      positively hides from us the figures of Captain Anthony and Flora de
      Barrel. Both the Knight and the Maiden&mdash;as the author names them&mdash;are
      retiring souls, and our hearts move in sympathy fin them as we contemplate
      their timid hesitancy before the voluble inquisitions of Marlowe, young
      Powell and the Fynes. Moreover, the intention of this method that it
      should secure realistic conviction for the most romantic episodes does not
      here achieve its purpose, as we have seen that it did in the first half of
      <span class="pagenum">52</span><a name="link052" id="link052"></a><i>Lord
      Jim</i> and the whole of <i>Nostromo</i>. We believe most emphatically in
      that first narration of young Powell&rsquo;s about his first chance. We believe
      in the first narration of Marlowe, although quite casually he talks like
      this: &ldquo;I do not even think that there was in what he did a conscious and
      lofty confidence in himself, a particularly pronounced sense of power
      which leads men so often into impossible or equivocal situations.&rdquo; We
      believe in the horrible governess (a fiercely drawn figure). We believe in
      Marlowe&rsquo;s interview with Flora on the pavement outside Anthony&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in the whole of the first half of the book, but even here we
      are conscious that we would prefer to be closer to the whole thing, that
      it would be pleasant to hear Flora and Anthony speak for themselves, that
      we resent, a little, Marlowe&rsquo;s intimacy which prevents, with patronising
      complaisance, the intimacy that we, the readers, might have seemed.
      Nevertheless we are so far held, we are captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the second half of the book <span class="pagenum">53</span><a
      name="link053" id="link053"></a>arrives we can be confident no longer.
      Here, as in <i>Lord Jim</i>, it is possible to feel that Conrad, having
      surprised, seized upon, mastered his original moment, did not know how to
      continue it. The true thing in <i>Lord Jim</i> is the affair of the <i>Patna</i>;
      the true thing in <i>Chance</i> is Captain Anthony&rsquo;s rescue of Flora after
      her disaster. But whereas in <i>Lord Jim</i> the sequel to Jim&rsquo;s cowardice
      has its own fine qualities of beauty and imagination, the sequel to
      Captain Anthony&rsquo;s rescue of Flora seems to one listener at any rate a
      pitiably unconvincing climax of huddled melodrama. That chapter in <i>Chance</i>
      entitled <i>A Moonless Night</i> is, in the first half of it, surely the
      worst thing that Conrad ever wrote, save only that one early short story,
      <i>The Return</i>. The conclusion of <i>Chance</i> and certain tales in
      his volume, <i>Within the Tides</i>, make one wonder whether that alliance
      between romance and realism that he has hitherto so wonderfully maintained
      is not breaking down before the baleful strength of the former of these
      two qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">54</span><a name="link054" id="link054"></a>It
      remains only to be said that when credence so entirely fails, as it must
      before the end of <i>Chance</i>, the form of narration in <i>Oratio Recta</i>
      is nothing less than maddening. Suddenly we do not believe in Marlowe, in
      Powell, in the Fynes: we do not believe even in Anthony and Flora. We are
      the angrier because earlier in the evening we were so completely taken in.
      It is as though we had given our money to a deserving cause and discovered
      a charlatan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have described at length the form in which the themes of these books are
      developed, because it is the form that, here extensively, here quite
      unobtrusively, clothes all the novels and tales. We are caught and held by
      the skinny finger of the Ancient Mariner. When he has a true tale to tell
      us his veritable presence is an added zest to our pleasure. But, if his
      presence be not true...
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      If we turn to the themes that engage Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s attention we shall
      see that <span class="pagenum">55</span><a name="link055" id="link055"></a>in
      almost every case his subjects are concerned with unequal combats&mdash;unequal
      to his own far-seeing vision, but never to the human souls engaged in
      them, and it is this consciousness of the blindness that renders men&rsquo;s
      honesty and heroism of so little account that gives occasion for his
      irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chooses, in almost every case, the most solid and unimaginative of
      human beings for his heroes, and it seems that it is these men alone whom
      he can admire. &ldquo;If a human soul has vision he simply gives the thing up,&rdquo;
       we can hear him say. &ldquo;He can see at once that the odds are too strong for
      him. But these simple souls, with their consciousness of the job before
      them and nothing else, with their placid sense of honour and of duty, upon
      them you may loosen all heaven&rsquo;s bolts and lightnings and they will not
      quail.&rdquo; They command his pity, his reverence, his tenderness, almost his
      love. But at the end, with an ironic shrug of his shoulders, he says: &ldquo;You
      see. I told you so. He may even think he has won. We know better, you and
      I.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">56</span><a name="link056" id="link056"></a>The
      theme of <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i> is a struggle of a weak man against
      nature, of <i>The Nigger of the Narcissus</i> the struggle of many simple
      men against the presence of death, of <i>Lord Jim</i>, again, the struggle
      of a simple man against nature (here the man wins, but only, we feel, at
      the cost of truth). <i>Nostromo</i>, the conquest of a child of nature by
      the silver mine which stands over him, conscious of its ultimate victory,
      from the very first. <i>Chance</i>, the struggle of an absolutely simple
      and upright soul against the dishonesties of a world that he does not
      understand. <i>Typhoon</i>, the very epitome of Conrad&rsquo;s themes, is the
      struggle of M&rsquo;Whirr against the storm (here again it is M&rsquo;Whirr who
      apparently wins, but we can hear, in the very last line of the book, the
      storm&rsquo;s confident chuckle of ultimate victory). In <i>Heart of Darkness</i>
      the victory is to the forest. In <i>The End of the Tether</i> Captain
      Whalley, one of Conrad&rsquo;s finest figures, is beaten by the very loftiness
      of his character. The three tales in <i>&lsquo;Twixt Land, and Sea</i> are all
      themes of this kind&mdash;the struggle of simple, <span class="pagenum">57</span><a
      name="link057" id="link057"></a>unimaginative men against forces too
      strong for them. In <i>The Secret Agent</i> Winnie Verloc, another simple
      character, finds life too much for her and commits suicide. In <i>Under
      Western Eyes</i> Razumov, the dreamer, is destroyed by a world that laughs
      at the pains and struggles of insignificant individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Conrad&rsquo;s philosophy I must speak in another place: here it is enough to
      say that it is impossible to imagine him choosing as the character of a
      story jolly, independent souls who take life for what it gives them and
      leave defeat or victory to the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Conrad&rsquo;s books are or are not, it may safely be said that they
      are never jolly, and his most devoted disciple would, in all probability,
      resent any suggestion of a lighter hand or a gentler affection, his art,
      nevertheless, is limited by this persistent brooding over the inequality
      of life&rsquo;s battle. His humour, often of a very fine kind, is always
      sinister, because his choice of theme forbids light-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Jones and Tristram Shandy would <span class="pagenum">58</span><a
      name="link058" id="link058"></a>have found Marlowe, Jim and Captain
      Anthony quite impossibly solemn company&mdash;but I do not deny that they
      might not have been something the better for a little of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already said that his characters are, for the most part, simple and
      unimaginative men, but that does not mean that they are so simple that
      there is nothing in them. The first thing of which one is sure in meeting
      a number of Conrad&rsquo;s characters is that they have existences and histories
      entirely independent of their introducer&rsquo;s kind offices. Conrad has met
      them, has talked to them, has come to know them, but we are sure not only
      that there is very much more that he could tell us about them if he had
      time and space, but that even when he had told us all that he knew he
      would only have touched on the fringe of their real histories.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the distinctions between the modern English novel and the
      mid-Victorian English novel is that modern characters have but little of
      the robust vitality of their <span class="pagenum">59</span><a
      name="link059" id="link059"></a>predecessors; the figures in the novel of
      to-day fade so easily from the page that endeavours to keep them.

      In the novels of Mr Henry James we feel at times that the characters fade
      before the motives attributed to them, in those of Mr Wells before an
      idea, a curse, or a remedy, in those of Mr Bennett before a creeping
      wilderness of important insignificances, in those of Mr Galsworthy before
      the oppression of social inequalities, in those of Mrs Wharton before the
      shadow of Mr Henry James, even in those of Mr Hardy before the omnipotence
      of an inevitable God whom, in spite of his inevitability, Mr Hardy himself
      is arranging in the background; it may be claimed for the characters of Mr
      Conrad that they yield their solidity to no force, no power, not even to
      their author&rsquo;s own determination that they are doomed, in the end, to
      defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not for a moment to say that Joseph Conrad is a finer novelist
      than these others, but this quality he has beyond his contemporaries&mdash;namely,
      the assurance that <span class="pagenum">60</span><a name="link060"      id="link060"></a>his characters have their lives and adventures both
      before and after the especial cases that he is describing to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian Tchekov has, in his plays, this gift supremely, so that at the
      close of <i>The Three Sisters</i> or <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> we are left
      speculating deeply upon &ldquo;what happened afterwards&rdquo; to Gayef or Barbara, to
      Masha or Epikhadov; with Conrad&rsquo;s sea captains as with Tchekov&rsquo;s Russians
      we see at once that they are entirely independent of the incidents that we
      are told about them. This independence springs partly from the author&rsquo;s
      eager, almost naïve curiosity. It is impossible for him to introduce us to
      any officer on his ship without whispering to us in an aside details about
      his life, his wife and family on shore. By so doing he forges an extra
      link in his chain of circumstantial evidence, but we do not feel that here
      he is deliberately serving his art&mdash;it is only that quality already
      mentioned, his own astonished delight at the things that he is
      discovering. We learn, for instance, about Captain M&rsquo;Whirr that he wrote
      long letters home, <span class="pagenum">61</span><a name="link061"      id="link061"></a>beginning always with the words, &ldquo;My darling Wife,&rdquo; and
      relating in minute detail each successive trip of the <i>Nan-Shan</i>. Mrs
      M&rsquo;Whirr, we learn, was &ldquo;a pretentious person with a scraggy neck and a
      disdainful manner, admittedly lady-like and in the neighbourhood
      considered as &lsquo;quite superior.&rsquo; The only secret of her life was her abject
      terror of the time when her husband would come home to stay for good.&rdquo;
       Also in <i>Typhoon</i> there is the second mate &ldquo;who never wrote any
      letters, did not seem to hope for news from anywhere; and though he had
      been heard once to mention West Hartlepool, it was with extreme
      bitterness, and only in connection with the extortionate charges of a
      boarding-house.&rdquo; How conscious we are of Jim&rsquo;s English country parsonage,
      of Captain Anthony&rsquo;s loneliness, of Marlowe&rsquo;s isolation. By this simple
      thread of connection between the land and the ship the whole character
      stands, human and convincing, before us. Of the sailors on board the <i>Narcissus</i>
      there is not one about whom, after his landing, <span class="pagenum">62</span><a
      name="link062" id="link062"></a>we are not curious. There is the skipper,
      whose wife comes on board, &ldquo;A real lady, in a black dress and with a
      parasol.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Very soon the captain, dressed very smartly and in a white
      shirt, went with her over the side. We didn&rsquo;t recognise him at all....&rdquo;
       And Mr Baker, the chief mate! Is not this little farewell enough to make
      us his friends for life?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one waited for him ashore. Mother died; father and two brothers,
      Yarmouth fishermen, drowned together on the Dogger Bank; sister married
      and unfriendly. Quite a lady, married to the leading tailor of a little
      town, and its leading politician, who did not think his sailor brother
      in-law quite respectable enough for him. Quite a lady, quite a lady, he
      thought, sitting down for a moment&rsquo;s rest on the quarter-hatch. Time
      enough to go ashore and get a bite, and sup, and a bed somewhere. He
      didn&rsquo;t like to part with a ship. No one to think about then. The darkness
      of a misty evening fell, cold and damp, upon the deserted deck; and Mr
      Baker sat smoking, thinking of all the successive ships to whom through
      many <span class="pagenum">63</span><a name="link063" id="link063"></a>long
      years he had given the best of a seaman&rsquo;s care. And never a command in
      sight. Not once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are others&mdash;the abominable Donkin for instance. &ldquo;Donkin
      entered. They discussed the account... Captain Allistoun said. &lsquo;I give you
      a bad discharge,&rsquo; he said quietly. Donkin raised his voice: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      your bloomin&rsquo; discharge&mdash;keep it. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter &lsquo;ave a job hashore.&rsquo;
      He turned to us. &lsquo;No more bloomin&rsquo; sea for me,&rsquo; he said, aloud. All looked
      at him. He had better clothes, had an easy air, appeared more at home than
      any of us; he stared with assurance, enjoying the effect of his
      declaration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In how many novels would Donkin&rsquo;s life have been limited by the part that
      he was required to play in the adventures of the <i>Narcissus?</i> As it
      is our interest in his progress has been satisfied by a prologue only. Or
      there is Charley, the boy of the crew&mdash;&ldquo;As I came up I saw a
      red-faced, blowzy woman, in a grey shawl, and with dusty, <span
      class="pagenum">64</span><a name="link064" id="link064"></a>fluffy hair,
      fall on Charley&rsquo;s neck. It was his mother. She slobbered over him:&mdash;&lsquo;Oh,
      my boy! my boy!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Leggo me,&rsquo; said Charley, &lsquo;leggo, mother!&rsquo; I was
      passing him at the time, and over the untidy head of the blubbering woman
      he gave me a humorous smile and a glance ironic, courageous, and profound,
      that seemed to put all my knowledge of life to shame. I nodded and passed
      on, but heard him say again, good-naturedly:&mdash;&lsquo;If you leggo of me
      this minyt&mdash;ye shall &lsquo;ave a bob for a drink out of my pay.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But one passes from these men of the sea&mdash;from M&rsquo;Whirr and Baker,
      from Lingard and Captain Whalley, from Captain Anthony and Jim, with a
      suspicion that the author will not convince us quite so readily with his
      men of the land&mdash;and that suspicion is never entirely dismissed.
      About such men as M&rsquo;Whirr and Baker he can tell us nothing that we will
      not believe. He has such sympathy and understanding for them that they
      will, we are assured, deliver up to him their dearest secrets&mdash;those
      little details, <span class="pagenum">65</span><a name="link065"      id="link065"></a>M&rsquo;Whirr&rsquo;s wife, Mr Baker&rsquo;s proud sister, Charley&rsquo;s
      mother, are their dearest secrets. But with the citizens of the other
      world&mdash;with Stein, Decoud, Gould, Verloc, Razumov, the sinister
      Nikita, the little Fynes, even the great Nostromo himself&mdash;we cannot
      be so confident, simply because their discoverer cannot yield them that
      same perfect sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His theory about these men is that they have, all of them, an <i>idée fixe</i>,
      that you must search for this patiently, honestly, unsparingly&mdash;having
      found it, the soul of the man is revealed to you. But is it? Is it not
      possible that Decoud or Verloc, feeling the probing finger, offer up
      instantly any <i>idée fixe</i> ready to hand because they wish to be left
      alone? Decoud himself, for instance&mdash;Decoud, the imaginative
      journalist in <i>Nostromo</i>, speculating with his ironic mind upon
      romantic features, at his heart, apparently cynical and reserved, the
      burning passion for the beautiful Antonia. He has yielded enough to
      suggest the truth, but the truth itself eludes us. With Verloc again <span
      class="pagenum">66</span><a name="link066" id="link066"></a>we have a
      quite masterly presentation of the man as Conrad sees him. That first
      description of him is wonderful, both in its reality and its significance.
      &ldquo;His eyes were naturally heavy, he had an air of having wallowed, fully
      dressed, all day on an unmade bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With many novelists that would be quite enough, that we should see the
      character as the author sees him, but because, in these histories, we have
      the convictions of the extension of the protagonists&rsquo; lives beyond the
      stated episodes, it is not enough. Because they have lives independent of
      the covers of the book we feel that there can be no end to the things that
      we should be told about them, and they must be true things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verloc, for instance, is attached from the first to his <i>idée fixe</i>&mdash;namely,
      that he should be able to retain, at all costs, his phlegmatic state of
      self-indulgence and should not be jockeyed out of it. At the first sign of
      threatened change he is terrified to his very soul. Conrad never, for an
      instant, allows him to leave this ground upon which he has <span
      class="pagenum">67</span><a name="link067" id="link067"></a>placed him. We
      see the man tied to his rock of an <i>idée fixe</i>, but he has,
      nevertheless, we are assured, another life, other motives, other humours,
      other terrors. It is perhaps a direct tribute to the authors reserve power
      that we feel, at the book&rsquo;s close, that we should have been told so much
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with the great Nostromo himself we are not satisfied as we are with
      Captain Whalley or Mr Kates. Nostromo is surely, as a picture, the moat
      romantically satisfying figure in the English novel since Scott, with the
      single exception of Thackeray&rsquo;s Beatrix&mdash;and here I am not forgetting
      Captain Silver, David Balfour, Catriona, nor, in our own immediate time,
      young Beauchamp or the hero of that amazing and so unjustly obscure
      fiction, <i>The Shadow of a Titan</i>. As a picture, Nostromo shines with
      a flaming colour, shines, as the whole novel shines, with a glow that is
      flung by the contrasted balance of its romance and realism. From that
      first vision of him as he rides slowly through the crowds, in his
      magnificent dress: &ldquo;... his hat, a gay sombrero with <span class="pagenum">68</span><a
      name="link068" id="link068"></a>a silver cord and tassels. The bright
      colours of a Mexican scrape twisted on the mantle, the enormous silver
      buttons on the embroidered leather jacket, the row of tiny silver buttons
      down the seam of the trousers, the snowy linen, a silk sash with
      embroidered ends, the silver plates on headstall and saddle... to that
      last moment when&mdash;... in the dimly lit room Nostromo rolled his head
      slowly on the pillow and opened his eyes, directing at the weird figure
      perched by his bedside a glance of enigmatic and mocking scorn. Then his
      head rolled back, his eyelids fell, and the Capatos of the Cargadores died
      without a word or moan after an hour of immobility, broken by short
      shudders testifying to the most atrocious sufferings&rdquo;&mdash;we are
      conscious of his superb figure; and after his death we do, indeed, believe
      what the last lines of the book assure us&mdash;&ldquo;In that true cry of love
      and grief that seemed to ring aloud from Punta Mala to Azuera and away to
      the bright line of the horizon, overhung by a big white cloud shining like
      a mass of solid silver, the <span class="pagenum">69</span><a
      name="link069" id="link069"></a>genius of the magnificent Capatuz de
      Cargadores dominated the dark gulf containing his conquests of treasure
      and love.&rdquo; His genius dominates, yes&mdash;but it is the genius of a
      magnificent picture standing as a frontispiece to the book of his soul.
      And that soul is not given us&mdash;Nostromo, proud to the last, refuses
      to surrender it to us. Why is it that the slender sketch of old Singleton
      in <i>The Nigger of the Narcissus</i> gives us the very heart of the man,
      so that volumes might tell us more of him indeed, but could not surrender
      him to us more truly, and all the fine summoning of Nostromo only leaves
      him beyond our grasp? We believe in Nostromo, but we are told about him&mdash;we
      have not met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, at another turn of the road, this criticism must seem the
      basest ingratitude. When we look back and survey that crowd, so various,
      so distinct whether it be they who are busied, before our eyes, with the
      daily life of Sulaoo, or the Verloc family (the most poignant scene in the
      whole of Conrad&rsquo;s art&mdash;the drive in the <span class="pagenum">70</span><a
      name="link070" id="link070"></a>cab of old Mrs Verloc, Winnie and Stevie&mdash;compels,
      additionally, our gratitude) or that strange gathering, the Haldins,
      Nikita, Laspara, Madame de S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, Peter Ivanovitch,
      Raznmov, at Geneva, or the highly coloured figures in <i>Romance</i> (a
      book fine in some places, astonishingly second-rate in others), Falk or
      Amy Foster, Jacobus and his daughter, Jasper and his lover, all those and
      so many, many more, what can we do but embrace the world that is offered
      to us, accept it as an axiom of life that, of all these figures, some will
      be near to us, some more distant? It is, finally, a world that Conrad
      offers us, not a series of novels in whose pages we find the same two or
      three figures returning to us&mdash;old friends with new faces and new
      names&mdash;but a planet that we know, even as we know the Meredith
      planet, the Hardy planet, the James planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, we may trace its towns and rivers, its continents and seas,
      its mean streets and deep valleys, its country houses, its sordid hovels,
      its vast, untamed forests, its deserts and wilderness s. Although each
      <span class="pagenum">71</span><a name="link071" id="link071"></a>work,
      from, the vast <i>Nostromo</i> to the minutely perfect <i>Secret Share</i>,
      has its new theme, its form, its separate heart, the swarming life that he
      has created knows no boundary. And in this, surely, creation has
      accomplished its noblest work.

      III&mdash;THE POET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE <span
      class="pagenum">72</span><a name="link072" id="link072"></a>poet in Conrad
      is lyrical as well as philosophic. The lyrical side is absent in certain
      of his works, as, for example, <i>The Secret Agent</i>, and <i>Under
      Western Eyes</i>, or such short stories as <i>The Informer</i>, or <i>Il
      Conde</i>, but the philosophic note sounded poetically, as an instrument
      of music as well as a philosophy, is never absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three elements in the work of Conrad the poet as distinct from Conrad the
      novelist deserve consideration&mdash;style, atmosphere and philosophy. In
      the matter of style the first point that must strike any constant reader
      of the novels is the change that is to be marked between the earlier works
      and the later. Here is a descriptive passage from <span class="pagenum">73</span><a
      name="link073" id="link073"></a>Conrad&rsquo;s second novel, <i>An Outcast of
      the Islands</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He followed her step by step till at last they both stopped, facing each
      other under the big tree of the enclosure. The solitary exile of the
      forests great, motionless and solemn in his abandonment, left alone by the
      life of ages that had been pushed away from him by those pigmies that
      crept at his foot, towered high and straight above their leader. He seemed
      to look on, dispassionate and imposing in his lonely greatness, spreading
      his branches wide in a gesture of lofty protection, as if to hide them in
      the sombre shelter of innumerable leaves; as if moved by the disdainful
      compassion of the strong, by the scornful pity of an aged giant, to screen
      this struggle of two human hearts from the cold scrutiny of glittering
      stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And from his latest novel, <i>Chance</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very sea, with short flashes of foam bursting out here and there in
      the gloomy distances, the unchangeable, safe sea sheltering a man from all
      passions, except its own anger, seemed queer to the quick <span
      class="pagenum">74</span><a name="link074" id="link074"></a>glance he
      threw to windward when the already effaced horizon traced no reassuring
      limit to the eye. In the expiring diffused twilight, and before the
      clouded night dropped its mysterious veil, it was the immensity of space
      made visible&mdash;almost palpable. Young Powell felt it. He felt it in
      the sudden sense of his isolation; the trustworthy, powerful ship of his
      first acquaintance reduced to a speck, to something almost
      undistinguishable. The mere support for the soles of his two feet before
      that unexpected old man becoming so suddenly articulate in a darkening
      universe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It must be remembered that the second of these quotations is the voice of
      Marlowe and that therefore it should, in necessity, be the simpler of the
      two. Nevertheless, the distinction can very clearly be observed. The first
      piece of prose is quite definitely lyrical: it has, it cannot be denied,
      something of the &ldquo;purple patch.&rdquo; We feel that the prose is too dependent
      upon sonorous adjectives, that it has the deliberation of work slightly
      affected by the author&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">75</span><a name="link075"      id="link075"></a>determination that it shall be fine. The rhythm in it,
      however, is as deliberate as the rhythm of any poem in English, the
      picture evoked as distinct and clear-cut as though it were, in actual
      tact, a poem detached from all context and, finally, there is the
      inevitable philosophical implication to give the argument to the picture.
      Such passages of descriptive prose may be found again and again in the
      earlier novels and tales of Conrad, in <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly, Tales of
      Unrest, The Nigger of the Narcissus, Typhoon, Youth, Heart of Darkness,
      Lord Jim</i>,&mdash;prose piled high with sonorous and slow-moving
      adjectives, three adjectives to a noun, prose that sounds hike an Eastern
      invocation to a deity in whom, nevertheless, the suppliant does not
      believe. At its worst, the strain that its sonority places upon movements
      and objects of no importance is disastrous. For instance, in the tale
      called <i>The Return</i>, there is the following passage:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saw her shoulder touch the lintel of the door. She swayed as if dazed.
      There was <span class="pagenum">76</span><a name="link076" id="link076"></a>less
      than a second of suspense while they both felt as if poised on the very
      edge of moral annihilation, ready to fall into some devouring nowhere.
      Then almost simultaneously he shouted, &lsquo;Come back,&rsquo; and she let go the
      handle of the door. She turned round in peaceful desperation like one who
      has deliberately thrown away the last chance of life; and for a moment the
      room she faced appeared terrible, and dark, and safe&mdash;like a grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The situation here simply will not bear the weight of the words&mdash;&ldquo;moral
      annihilation,&rdquo; &ldquo;devouring nowhere,&rdquo; &ldquo;peaceful desperation,&rdquo; &ldquo;last chance
      of life,&rdquo; &ldquo;terrible,&rdquo; &ldquo;like a grave.&rdquo; That he shouted gives a final touch
      of ludicrous exaggeration to the whole passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, in the earlier books, Conrad&rsquo;s style has the awkward over-emphasis
      of a writer who is still acquiring the language that he is using, like a
      foreigner who shouts to us because he thinks that thus we shall understand
      him more easily. But there is also, in this earlier style, the marked
      effect of <span class="pagenum">77</span><a name="link077" id="link077"></a>two
      influences. One influence is that of the French language and especially of
      the author of <i>Madame Bovary</i>. When we recollect that Conrad
      hesitated at the beginning of his career as to whether he would write in
      French or English, we can understand this French inflection. Flaubert&rsquo;s
      effect on his style is quite unmistakable. This is a sentence of
      Flaubert&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Toutes ses velléités de dénigrement l&rsquo;envanouissaiont sous la
      poésie du rôle qui l&rsquo;envahissait; et entrainée vers l&rsquo;homme par l&rsquo;illusion
      du personnage elle tâcha de se figurer sa vie, cette vie retentissante,
      extraordinaire, splendide...&rdquo; and this a sentence of Conrad&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Her hands
      slipped slowly off Lingard&rsquo;s shoulders and her arms tell by her side,
      listless, discouraged, as if to her&mdash;to her, the savage, violent and
      ignorant creature&mdash;had been revealed clearly in that moment the
      tremendous fact of our isolation, of the loneliness, impenetrable and
      transparent, elusive and everlasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conrad&rsquo;s sentence reads like a direct translation from the French, It is
      probable, <span class="pagenum">78</span><a name="link078" id="link078"></a>however,
      that his debt to Flaubert and the French language can be very easily
      exaggerated, and it does not seem, in any case, to have driven very deeply
      into the heart of his form. The influence is mainly to be detected in the
      arrangement of words and sentences as though he had in the first years of
      his work, used it as a crutch before he could walk alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second of the early influences upon his style is of far greater
      importance&mdash;the influence of the vast, unfettered elements of nature
      that he had, for so many years, so directly served. If it were not for his
      remarkable creative gift that had been, from the very first, at its full
      strength, his early books would stand as purely lyrical evocations of the
      sea and the forest. It is the poetry of the Old Testament of which we
      think in many pages of <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i> and <i>An Outcast of the
      Island</i>, a poetry that has the rhythm and metre of a spontaneous
      emotion. He was never again to catch quite the spirit of that first
      rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was under the influence of these powers <span class="pagenum">79</span><a
      name="link079" id="link079"></a>also in that, at that time, they were too
      strong for him. We feel with him that he is impotent to express his wonder
      and praise because he is still so immediately under their sway. His style,
      in these earlier hooks, has the repetitions and extended phrases of a man
      who is marking time before the inspired moment comes to him&mdash;often
      the inspiration does not come because he cannot detach himselt with
      sufficient pause and balance. But in his middle period, in the period of
      <i>Youth, Typhoon, Heart of Darkness</i> and <i>Nostromo</i>, this lyrical
      impulse can be seen at its perfection, beating, steadily, spontaneously,
      with the finest freedom and yet disciplined, as it were, by its own will
      and desire. Compare, for a moment, this passage from <i>Typhoon</i> with
      that earlier one from <i>The Outcast of the Islands</i> that I quoted
      above:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He watched her, battered and solitary, labouring heavily in a wild scene
      of mountainous black waters lit by the gleam of distant worlds. She moved
      slowly, breathing into the still core of the hurricane <span
      class="pagenum">80</span><a name="link080" id="link080"></a>the excess of
      her strength in a white cloud of steam, and the deep-toned vibration of
      the escape was like the defiant trumpeting of a living creature of the sea
      impatient for the renewal of the contest. It ceased suddenly. The still
      air moaned. Above Jakes&rsquo; head a few stars shone into the pit of black
      vapours. The inky edge of the cloud-disc frowned upon the ship under the
      patch of glittering sky. The stars too seemed to look at her intently, as
      if for the last time, and the cluster of their splendour sat like a diadem
      on a lowering brow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is poet&rsquo;s work, and poet&rsquo;s work at its finest. Instead of impressing
      us, as the earlier piece of prose, with the fact that the author has made
      the very most of a rather thin moment&mdash;feels, indeed, himself that it
      is thin&mdash;we are here under the influence of something that can have
      no limits to the splendours that it contains. The work is thick, as though
      it had been wrought by the finest workman out of the heart of the finest
      material&mdash;and yet it remains, through all its discipline,
      spontaneous.
    </p>
    <p>
      These three tales, <i>Typhoon, Youth</i> and <span class="pagenum">81</span><a
      name="link081" id="link081"></a><i>Heart of Darkness</i>, stand by
      themselves as the final expression of Conrad&rsquo;s lyrical gift. We may
      remember such characters as M&rsquo;Whirr, Kurtz, Marlowe, but they are figures
      as the old seneschal in <i>The Eve of St Agnes</i> or the Ancient Mariner
      himself are figures. They are as surely complete poems, wrought and
      finished in the true spirit of poetry, as Whitman&rsquo;s <i>When Lilac first on
      the Door yard bloomed</i> or Keats&rsquo; <i>Nightingale.</i> Their author was
      never again to succeed so completely in combining the free spirit of his
      enthusiasm with the disciplined restraint of the true artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third period of his style shows him cool and clear-headed as to the
      things that he intends to do. He is now the slightly ironic, artist whose
      business is to get things on to paper in the clearest possible way. He is
      conscious that in the past he has been at the mercy of sonorous and
      high-sounding adjectives. He will use them still, but only to show them
      that they are at his mercy. Marlowe, his appointed minister, is older&mdash;he
      must look back now on the colours of <span class="pagenum">82</span><a
      name="link082" id="link082"></a><i>Youth</i> with an indulgent smile. And
      when Marlowe is absent, in such novels as <i>The Secret Agent</i> and <i>Under
      Western Eyes</i>, in such a volume of stories as <i>A Set of Six</i>, the
      lyrical beat in the style is utterly abandoned&mdash;we are led forward by
      sentences as grave, as assured, and sometimes as ponderous as a city
      policeman. Nevertheless, in that passage from <i>Chance</i> quoted at the
      beginning of the chapter, although we may be far from the undisciplined
      enthusiasm of <i>An Outcast of the Islands</i>, the lyrical impulse still
      remains. Yes, it is there, but&mdash;&ldquo;Young Powell felt it.&rdquo; In that
      magical storm that was <i>Typhoon</i> God alone can share our terror and
      demand our courage; in the later experience young Powell is our companion.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The question of style devolves here directly into the question of
      atmosphere. There may roughly be said to be four classes of novelists in
      the matter of atmosphere. There is the novelist who, intent upon his <span
      class="pagenum">83</span><a name="link083" id="link083"></a>daily bread or
      game of golf, has no desire to be worried by such a perplexing business.
      He produces stories that might without loss play the whole of their action
      in the waiting-room of an English railway station. There is the novelist
      who thinks that atmosphere matters immensely, who works hard to produce it
      and <i>does</i> produce it in thick slabs. There are the novelists whose
      theme, characters and background react so admirably that the atmosphere is
      provided simply by that reaction&mdash;and there, finally, it is left, put
      into no relation with other atmospheres, serving no further purpose than
      the immediate one of stating the facts. Of this school are the realists
      and, in our own day, Mr Arnold Bennett&rsquo;s Brighton background in <i>Hilda
      Lessways</i> or Mrs Wharton&rsquo;s New York background in <i>The House of Mirth</i>
      offer most successful examples of such realistic work. The fourth class
      provides us with the novelists who wish to place their atmosphere in
      relation with the rest of life. Our imagination is awakened, insensibly,
      by the contemplation of some scene and is thence <span class="pagenum">84</span><a
      name="link084" id="link084"></a>extended to the whole vista, of life, from
      birth to death; although the scene may actually be as remote or as
      conlined as space can make it, its potential limits are boundless, its
      progression is extended beyond all possibilities of definition. Such a
      moment is the death of Bazarov in <i>Fathers and Children</i>, the
      searching of Dmitri in <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, the scene at the
      theatre in <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, the London meeting between
      Beauchamp and René in <i>Beauchamp&rsquo;s Career</i>. It is not only that these
      scenes are &ldquo;done&rdquo; to the full extent of their &ldquo;doing,&rdquo; it is also that
      they have behind them the lyrical impulse that ignites them with all the
      emotion and beauty in the history of the world; Turgeniev, Dostoievsky,
      Browning, Meredith were amongst the greatest of the poets. Conrad, at his
      highest moments, is also of that company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not enough to say that this potential atmosphere is simply
      lyrical. Mr Chesterton, in his breathless <i>Victorian Age in Literature</i>,
      has named this element Glamour. <span class="pagenum">85</span><a
      name="link085" id="link085"></a>In writing of the novels by George Eliot
      he says: &ldquo;Indeed there is almost every element of literature, except a
      certain indescribable thing called <i>Glamour</i>, which was the whole
      stock-in-trade of the Brontes, which we feel in Dickens when Quilp
      clambers, and rotten wood by the desolate river; and even in Thackeray,
      when Edmond wanders like some swarthy crow about the dismal avenues of
      Castlewood.&rdquo; Now&rsquo; this matter of <i>Glamour</i> is not all, because
      Dickens, for instance, is not at all potential. His pictures of Quilp or
      the house of the Dedloeks or Jonas Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s escape after the murder do
      not put us into touch with other worlds&mdash;but we may say, at any rate,
      that when, in a novel atmosphere <i>is</i> potential it is certain also to
      have glamour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential qualities of Conrad&rsquo;s atmosphere are amongst his very
      strongest gifts and, it we investigate the matter, we see that it is his
      union of Romance and Realism that gives such results. Of almost no
      important scene in his novels is it possible to define the boundaries. In
      <i>The Outcast <span class="pagenum">86</span><a name="link086"      id="link086"></a>of the Islands</i>, when Willems is exiled by Captain
      Lingard, the terror of that forest has at its heart not only the actual
      terror of that immediate scene, minutely and realistically described&mdash;it
      has also the terror of all our knowledge of loneliness, desolation, the
      power of something stronger than ourselves. In <i>Lord Jim</i> the
      contrast of Jim with the officers of the <i>Patna</i> is a contrast not
      only immediately vital and realised to the very fringe of the captain&rsquo;s
      gay and soiled pyjamas, but also potential to the very limits of our
      ultimate conception of the eternal contrast between good and evil,
      degradation and vigour, ugliness and beauty. In <i>The Nigger of the
      Narcissus</i> the death of the negro, James Wait, immediately affects the
      lives of a number of very ordinary human beings whose friends and
      intimates we have become&mdash;but that shadow that traps the feet of the
      negro, that alarms the souls of Donkin, of Belfast, of Singleton, of the
      boy Charlie, creeps also to our sides and envelops for us far more than
      that single voyage of the <i>Narcissus</i>. <span class="pagenum">87</span><a
      name="link087" id="link087"></a>When Winnie Verloc, her old mother and the
      boy Stevie, take their journey in the cab it does not seem ludicrous to us
      that the tears of &ldquo;that large female in a dark, dusty wig, and ancient
      silk dress festooned with dingy white cotton lace&rdquo; should move us as
      though Mrs Verloc were our nearest friend. That mournful but courageous
      journey remains in our mind as an intimate companion of our own mournful
      and courageous experiences. Such examples might be multiplied quite
      indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has always secured his atmosphere by his own eager curiosity about
      significant detail, but his detail is significant, not because he wishes
      to impress his reader with the realism of his picture, but rather because
      he s, like a very small boy in a strange house, pursuing the most romantic
      adventures for his own pleasure and excitement only. We may hear, with
      many novelists, the click of satisfaction with which they drive another
      nail into the framework that supports their picture. &ldquo;Now see how firmly
      it stands,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;That last nail settled it.&rdquo; But <span
      class="pagenum">88</span><a name="link088" id="link088"></a>Conrad is
      utterly unconscious as to his readers&rsquo; later credulity&mdash;he is too
      completely held by his own amazing discoveries. Sometimes, as in <i>The
      Return</i>, when no vision is granted to him, it is as though he were
      banging on a brass tray with all his strength so that no one should
      perceive his own grievous disappointment at his failure. But, in his real
      discoveries, how the atmosphere piles itself up, around and about him, how
      we follow at his heels, penetrating the darkness, trusting to his courage,
      finding ourselves suddenly blinded by the blaze of Aladdin&rsquo;s cave! If he
      is tracing the tragedy of Willems and Almayer, a tragedy that has for its
      natural background the gorgeous, heavy splendour of those unending
      forests, he sees details that belong to the austerest and most sharply
      disciplined realism. We see Lakamba, asleep under the moon, slapping
      himself in his dreams to keep off the mosquitoes; a bluebottle comes
      buzzing into the verandah above the dirty plates of a half-finished meal
      and defies Lingard and Almayer, so <span class="pagenum">89</span><a
      name="link089" id="link089"></a>that they are like men disheartened by
      some tremendous failure; the cards with which Lingard tries to build a
      house for Almayer&rsquo;s baby are &ldquo;a dirty double pack&rdquo; with which he used to
      play Chinese bézique&mdash;it bored Almayer but the old seaman delighted
      in it, considering it a remarkable product of Chinese genius. The
      atmosphere of the terrible final chapters is set against this picture of a
      room in which Mrs Willems is waiting for her abominable husband:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bits of white stuff; rags yellow, pink, blue; rags limp, brilliant and
      soiled, trailed on the floor, lay on the desk amongst the sombre covers of
      books soiled, greasy, but stiff-backed in virtue, perhaps, of their
      European origin. The biggest set of bookshelves was partly hidden by a
      petticoat, the waistband of which was caught upon the back of a slender
      book pulled a little out of the row so as to make an improvised
      clothes-peg. The folding canvas bedstead stood anyhow, parallel to no
      wall, as if it had been, in the process of transportation to some remote
      place, dropped casually there by tired bearers. And on the tumbled
      blankets that <span class="pagenum">90</span><a name="link090" id="link090"></a>lay
      in a disordered heap on its edge, Joanna sat.... Through the half-open
      shutter a ray of sunlight, a ray merciless and crude, came into the room,
      beat in the early morning upon the safe in the far-off corner, then,
      travelling against the sun, cut at midday the big desk in two with its
      solid and clean-edged brilliance; with its hot brilliance in which a swarm
      of flies hovered in dancing flight over some dirty plate forgotten there
      amongst yellow papers for many a day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this room is set in the very heart of the forests&mdash;&ldquo;the forests
      unattainable, enigmatical, for ever beyond reach like the stars of heaven&mdash;and
      as indifferent.&rdquo; Had I space I could multiply from every novel and tale
      examples of this creation of atmosphere by the juxtaposition of the
      lyrical and the realistic&mdash;the lyrical pulse beating through
      realistic detail ami transforming it. I will, however, select one book, a
      supreme example of this effect. What I say about <i>Nostromo</i> may be
      proved from any other work of Conrad&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theme of <i>Nostromo</i> is the domination <span class="pagenum">91</span><a
      name="link091" id="link091"></a>of the silver of the Sulaco mine over the
      bodies and souls of the human beings who live near it. The light of the
      silver shines over the book. It is typified by &ldquo;the white head of
      Iliguerota rising majestically upon the blue.&rdquo; Conrad, then, in choosing
      his theme, has selected the most romantic possible, the spirit of silver
      treasure luring men on desperately to adventure and to death. His
      atmosphere, therefore, is, in its highest lights, romantic, even until
      that last vision of all of &ldquo;the bright line of the horizon, overhung by a
      big white cloud shining like a mass of solid silver.&rdquo; Sulaco burns with
      colour. We can see, as though we had been there yesterday, those streets
      with the coaches, &ldquo;great family arks swayed on high leathern springs full
      of pretty powdered faces in which the eyes looked intensely alive and
      black,&rdquo; the houses, &ldquo;in the early sunshine, delicate primrose, pale pink,
      pale blue,&rdquo; or, after dark, from Mrs Gould&rsquo;s balcony &ldquo;towards the plaza
      end of the street the glowing coals in the hazeros of the market women
      cooking their <span class="pagenum">92</span><a name="link092" id="link092"></a>evening
      meal glowed red along the edge of the pavement. A man appeared without a
      sound in the light of a street lamp, showing the coloured inverted
      triangle of his broidered poncho, square on his shoulders, hanging to a
      point below his knees. From the harbour end of the Calle a horseman walked
      his soft-stepping mount, gleaming silver-grey abreast each lamp under the
      dark shape of the rider.&rdquo; Later there is that sinister glimpse of the
      plaza, &ldquo;where a patrol of cavalry rode round and round without penetrating
      into the streets which resounded with shouts and the strumming of guitars
      issuing from the open doors of pulperias... and above the roofs, next to
      the perpendicular lines of the cathedral towers the snowy curve of
      Higuerota blocked a large space of darkening blue sky before the windows
      of the Intendencia.&rdquo; In its final created beauty Sulaco is as romantic, as
      coloured as one of those cloud-topped, many-towered towns under whose
      gates we watch Grimm&rsquo;s princes and princesses passing&mdash;but the detail
      of it is <span class="pagenum">93</span><a name="link093" id="link093"></a>built
      with careful realism demanded by the &ldquo;architecture of Manchester or
      Birmingham.&rdquo; We wonder, as Sulaco grows familiar to us, as we realise its
      cathedral, its squares and streets and houses, its slums, its wharves, its
      sea, its hills and forests, why it is that other novelists have not
      created towns for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony Trollope did, indeed, give us Barchester, but Barchester is a
      shadow beside Sulaco. Mr Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s Wessex map is the most fascinating
      document in modern fiction, with the possible exception of Stevenson&rsquo;s
      chart in <i>Treasure Island</i>. Conrad, without any map at all, gives us
      a familiarity with a small town on the South American coast that far
      excels our knowledge of Barsetshire, Wessex and John Silver&rsquo;s treasure. If
      any attentive reader of <i>Nostromo</i> were put down in Sulaco tomorrow
      he would feel as though he had returned to his native town. The detail
      that provides this final picture is throughout the book incessant but
      never intruding. We do not look back, when the novel is <span
      class="pagenum">94</span><a name="link094" id="link094"></a>finished, to
      any especial moment of explanation or introduction. We have been led,
      quite unconsciously, forward. We are led, at moments of the deepest drama,
      through rooms and passages that are only remembered, many hours later, in
      retrospect. There is, for instance, the Aristocratic Club, that &ldquo;extended
      to strangers the large hospitality of the cool, big rooms of its historic
      quarters in the front part of a house, once a residence of a High official
      of the Holy Office. The two wings, shut up, crumbled behind the nailed
      doors, and what may be described as a grove of young orange-trees grown in
      the unpaved patio concealed the utter ruin of the back part facing the
      gate. You turned in from the street, as if entering a secluded orchard,
      where you came upon the foot of a disjointed staircase, guarded by a
      moss-stained effigy of some saintly bishop, mitred and stalled, and
      bearing the indignity of a broken nose meekly, with his fine stone hands
      crossed on his breast. The chocolate-coloured faces of servants with mops
      of black hair peeped at you from above; the click of billiard balls came
      to your ears, and, <span class="pagenum">95</span><a name="link095"      id="link095"></a>ascending the steps, you would perhaps see in the first
      steps, very stiff upon a straight-backed chair, in a good light, Don Pépé
      moving his long moustaches as he spelt his way, at arm&rsquo;s length, through
      an old Sta Marta newspaper. His horse&mdash;a strong-hearted but
      persevering black brute, with a hammer bead&mdash;you would have seen in
      the street dozing motionless under an immense saddle, with its nose almost
      touching the curbstone of the side-walk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How perfectly recollected is that passage! Can we not hear the exclamation
      of some reader &ldquo;Yes&mdash;those orange-trees! It was just like that when I
      was there!&rdquo; How convinced we are of Conrad&rsquo;s unimpeachable veracity! How
      like him are those remembered details, &ldquo;the nailed doors,&rdquo; &ldquo;the fine stone
      hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;at arm&rsquo;s-length&rdquo;!&mdash;and can we not sniff something of the
      author&rsquo;s impatience to let himself go and tell us more about that
      &ldquo;hammer-headed horse&rdquo; of whose adventures with Don Pépé he must remember
      enough to fill a volume!
    </p>
    <p>
      He is able, therefore, upon this foundation <span class="pagenum">96</span><a
      name="link096" id="link096"></a>of a minute and scrupulous réalisai to
      build as fantastic a building as he pleases without fear of denying Truth.
      He does not, in <i>Nostromo</i> at any rate, choose to be fantastic, but
      he is romantic, and our final impression of the silver mine and the town
      under its white shining shadow is of something both as real and as
      beautiful as any vision of Keats or Shelley. But with the colour we
      remember also the grim tragedy of the life that has been shown to us. Near
      to the cathedral and the little tinkering streets of the guitars were the
      last awful struggles of the unhappy Hirsch. We remember Nostromo riding,
      with his silver buttons, catching the red flower flung to him out of the
      crowd, but we remember also his death and the agony of his defeated pride.
      Sotillo, the vainest and most sordid of bandits, is no figure for a fairy
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, is the secret of Conrad&rsquo;s atmosphere. He is the poet, working
      through realism, to the poetic vision of life. That intention is at the
      heart of his work from the first line of <i>Almayer s Folly</i> to the
      last <span class="pagenum">97</span><a name="link097" id="link097"></a>line
      of <i>Victory. Nostromo</i> is not simply the history of certain lives
      that were concerned in a South American revolution. It <i>is</i> that
      history, but it is also a vision, a statement of beauty that has no
      country, nor period, and sets no barrier of immediate history or fable for
      its interpretation....
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, we come finally to the philosophy that lies behind this
      creation of character and atmosphere we perceive, beyond question, certain
      limitations.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      As we have already seen, Conrad is of the firm and resolute conviction
      that life is too strong, too clever and too remorseless for the sons of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is as though, from some high window, looking down, he were able to
      watch some shore, from whose security men were for ever launching little
      cockle-shell boats upon a limitless and angry sea. He observes them, as
      they advance with confidence, with determination, each with his own sure
      <span class="pagenum">98</span><a name="link098" id="link098"></a>ambition
      of nailing victory to his mast; he alone can see that the horizon is
      limitless; he can see farther than they&mdash;from his height he can
      follow their fortunes, their brave struggles, their fortitude to the very
      last. He admires that courage, the simplicity of that faith, but his irony
      springs from his knowledge of the inevitable end.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are, we may thankfully maintain, other possible views of life, and
      it is, surely, Conrad&rsquo;s harshest limitation that he should never be free
      from this certain obsession of the vanity of human struggle. So bound is
      he by this that he is driven to choose characters who will prove his
      faith. We can remember many fine and courageous characters of his
      creation, we can remember no single one who is not foredoomed to defeat.
      Jim wins, indeed, his victory, but at the close: &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the end. He
      passes away under a cloud, inscrutable at heart, forgotten, unforgiven,
      and excessively romantic.... He goes away from a living woman to celebrate
      his pitiless wedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct.&rdquo; <span
      class="pagenum">99</span><a name="link099" id="link099"></a>Conrad&rsquo;s
      ironical smile that has watched with tenderness the history of Jim&rsquo;s
      endeavours, proclaims, at the last, that that pursuit has been vain&mdash;as
      vain as Stein&rsquo;s butterflies.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, for the rest, as Mr Curle in his study of Conrad has admirably
      observed, every character is faced with the enemy for whom he is, by
      character, least fitted. Nostromo, whose heart&rsquo;s desire it is that his
      merits should be acclaimed before men, is devoured by the one dragon to
      whom human achievements are nothing&mdash;lust of treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      M&rsquo;Whirr, the most unimaginative of men, is opposed by the most tremendous
      of God&rsquo;s splendid terrors and, although he saves his ship from the storm,
      so blind is he to the meaning of the things that he has witnessed that he
      might as well have never been born. Captain Brierley, watching the
      degradation of a fellow-creature from a security that nothing, it seems,
      can threaten, is himself caught by that very degradation.... The Beast in
      the Jungle is waiting ever ready to leap&mdash;the victim is always in his
      power. <span class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a>It
      comes from this philosophy of life that the qualities in the human soul
      that Conrad most definitely admires are blind courage and obedience to
      duty. His men of brain&mdash;Marlowe, Decoud, Stein&mdash;are melancholy
      and ironic: &ldquo;If you see far enough you must see how hopeless the struggle
      is.&rdquo; The only way to be honestly happy is to have no imagination and,
      because Conrad is tender at heart and would have his characters happy, if
      possible, he chooses men without imagination. Those are the men of the sea
      whom he has known and loved. The men of the land see farther than the men
      of the sea and must, therefore, be either fools or knaves. Towards Captain
      Anthony, towards Captain Lingard he extends his love and pity. For Verloc,
      for Ossipon, for old De Barral he has a disgust that is beyond words. For
      the Fynes and their brethren he has contempt. For two women of the land,
      Winnie Verloc and Mrs Gould, he reserves his love, and for them alone, but
      they have, in their hearts, the simplicity, the honesty of his own sea
      captains. <span class="pagenum">101</span><a name="link101" id="link101"></a>This
      then is quite simply his philosophy. It has no variation or relief. He
      will not permit his characters to escape, he will not himself try to draw
      the soul of a man who is stronger than Fate. His ironic melancholy does
      not, tor an instant, hamper his interest&mdash;that is as keen and acute
      as is the absorption of any collector of specimens&mdash;but at the end of
      it all, as with his own Stein: &ldquo;He says of him that he is &lsquo;preparing to
      leave all this: preparing to leave...&rsquo; while he waves his hand sadly at
      his butterflies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Utterly opposed is it from the philosophy of the one English writer whom,
      in all other ways, Conrad most obviously resembles&mdash;Robert Browning.
      As philosophers they have no possible ground of communication, save in the
      honesty that is common to both of them. As artists, both in their subjects
      and their treatment of their subjects, they are, in many ways, of an
      amazing resemblance, although the thorough investigation of that
      resemblance would need far more space than I can give it here. Browning&rsquo;s
      <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>interest
      in life was derived, on the novelist&rsquo;s side of him, from his absorption in
      the affairs, spiritual and physical, of men and women; on the poet&rsquo;s side,
      in the question again spiritual and physical, that arose from those
      affairs. Conrad has not Browning&rsquo;s clear-eyed realisation of the necessity
      of discovering the individual philosophy that belongs to every individual
      case&mdash;he is too immediately enveloped in his one overwhelming
      melancholy analysis. But he has exactly that eager, passionate pursuit of
      romance, a romance to be seized only through the most accurate and honest
      realism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browning&rsquo;s realism was born of his excitement at the number and interest
      of his discoveries; he chose, for instance, in <i>Sordello</i> the most
      romantic of subjects, and, having made his choice, found that there was
      such a world of realistic detail in the case that, in his excitement, he
      forgot that the rest of the world did not know quite as much as he did. Is
      not this exactly what we may say of <i>Nostromo?</i> Mr Chesterton has
      written of <span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>Browning:
      &ldquo;He substituted the street with the green blind for the faded garden of
      Watteau, and the &lsquo;blue spirt of a lighted match&rsquo; for the monotony of the
      evening star.&rdquo; Conrad has substituted for the lover serenading his
      mistress&rsquo; window the passion of a middle-aged, faded woman for her idiot
      boy, or the elopement of the daughter of a fraudulent speculator with an
      elderly, taciturn sea captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters upon whom Robert Browning lavished his affection are
      precisely Conrad&rsquo;s characters. Is not Waring Conrad&rsquo;s man?
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the rest, is not Mr Sludge own brother to Verloc and old De
      Barrel? Bishop Blougram first cousin to the great Personage in <i>The
      Secret Agent</i>, Captain Anthony brother to Caponsacchi, Mrs Gould sister
      to Pompilia? It is not only that Browning and Conrad both investigate
      these characters with the same determination to extract the last word of
      truth from the matter, not grimly, but with a thrilling beat of the heart,
      it is also that the worlds of these <span class="pagenum">104</span><a
      name="link104" id="link104"></a>two poets are the same. How deeply would
      Nostromo, Decoud, Gould, Monyngham, the Verlocs, Flora de Barrel, M&rsquo;Whirr,
      Jim have interested Browning! Surely Conrad has witnessed the revelation
      of Caliban, of Childe Roland, of James Lee&rsquo;s wife, of the figures in the
      Arezzo tragedy, even of that bishop who ordered his tomb at St Praxed&rsquo;s
      Church, with a strange wonder as though he himself had assisted at these
      discoveries!
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, with its multiplied witnesses, its
      statement as a &ldquo;case&rdquo; of life, its pursuit of beauty through truth, the
      simplicity of the characters of Pompilia, Caponsacchi and the Pope, the
      last frantic appeal of Guido, the detail, encrusted thick in the walls of
      that superb building&mdash;here we can see the highest pinnacle of that
      temple that has <i>Chance, Lord Jim, Nostromo</i> amongst its other
      turrets, buttresses and towers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conrad is his own master&mdash;he has imitated no one, he has created, as
      I have already said, his own planet, but the heights to which Browning
      carried Romantic-Realism showed <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>the author of <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i> the
      signs of the road that he was to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, as has often been said, Browning was as truly novelist as poet, may we
      not now say with equal justice that Conrad is as truly poet as novelist?

      IV&mdash;ROMANCE AND REALISM

      I
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE <span
      class="pagenum">106</span><a name="link106" id="link106"></a>terms,
      Romance and Realism, have been used of late years very largely as a means
      of escape from this business of the creation of character. The purely
      romantic novel may now be said to be, in England at any rate, absolutely
      dead. Mr Frank Swinnerton, in his study of <i>Robert Louis Stevenson</i>,
      said: &ldquo;Stevenson, reviving the never-very-prosperous romance of England,
      created a school which has brought romance to be the sweepings of an old
      costume-chest;... if romance is to be conventional in a double sense, if
      it spring not from a personal vision of life, but is only a tedious
      virtuosity, a pretence, a conscious toy, romance as an art is dead. The
      art was jaded when Reade finished his vocifer<span class="pagenum">107</span><a
      name="link107" id="link107"></a>ous carpet-beating; but it was not dead.
      And if it is dead, Stevenson killed it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We may differ very considerably from Mr Swinnerton with regard to his
      estimate of Stevenson&rsquo;s present and future literary value without denying
      that the date of the publication of <i>St Ives</i> was also the date of
      the death of the purely romantic novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, surely, here, as Mr Swinnerton himself infers, the term &ldquo;Romantic&rdquo; is
      used in the limited and truncated idea that has formed, lately the popular
      idea of Romance. In exactly the same way the term &ldquo;Realism&rdquo; has, recently,
      been most foolishly and uncritically handicapped. Romance, in its modern
      use, covers everything that is removed from reality: &ldquo;I like romances,&rdquo; we
      hear the modern reader say, &ldquo;because they take me away from real life,
      which I desire to forget.&rdquo; In the same way Realism is defined by its
      enemies as a photographic enumeration of unimportant facts by an observant
      pessimist. &ldquo;I like realism,&rdquo; admirers of a certain order of novel <span
      class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108" id="link108"></a>exclaim,
      &ldquo;because it is so like life. It tells me just what I myself see every day&mdash;I
      know where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, impatient though we may be of these utterly false ideas of
      Romance and Realism, a definition of those terms that will satisfy
      everyone is almost impossible. I cannot hope to achieve so exclusive an
      ambition&mdash;I can only say that to myself Realism is the study of life
      with all the rational faculties of observation, reason and reminiscence&mdash;Romance
      is the study of life with the faculties of imagination. I do not mean that
      Realism may not be emotional, poetic, even lyrical, but it is based always
      upon truth perceived and recorded&mdash;-it is the essence ol observation.
      In the same way Romance may be, indeed must be, accurate and defined in
      its own world, but its spirit is the spirit of imagination, working often
      upon observation and sometimes simply upon inspiration. It is, at any
      rate, understood here that the word Romance does not, for a moment, imply
      a necessary divorce from reality, nor does <span class="pagenum">109</span><a
      name="link109" id="link109"></a>Realism imply a detailed and dusty
      preference for morbid and unagreeable subjects. It is possible for Romance
      to be as honestly and clearly perceptive as Realism, but it is not so easy
      for it to be so because imagination is more difficult of discipline than
      observation. It is possible for Realism to be as eloquent and potential as
      Romance, although it cannot so easily achieve eloquence because of its
      fear of deserting truth. Moreover, with regard to the influence of foreign
      literature upon the English novel, it may be suggested that the influence
      of the French novel, which was at its strongest between the years of 1885
      and 1895, was towards Realism, and that the influence of the Russian
      novel, which has certainly been very strongly marked in England during the
      last years, is all towards Romantic-Realism. If we wished to know exactly
      what is meant by Romantic-Realism, such a novel as <i>The Brothers
      Karamazov</i>, such a play as <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> are there before
      us, as the best possible examples. We might say, in a word, that <i>Karamazov</i>
      has, in the England <span class="pagenum">110</span><a name="link110"      id="link110"></a>of 1915, taken the place that was occupied, in 1890, by
      <i>Madame Bovary</i>....
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is Joseph Conrad whose influence is chiefly responsible for this
      development in the English novel. Just as, in the early nineties, Mr Henry
      James and Mr Rudyard Kipling, the one potential, the other kinetic,
      influenced, beyond all contemporary novelists, the minds of their younger
      generation, so to-day, twenty-five years later, do Mr Joseph Conrad and Mr
      H. G. Wells, the one potential, the other kinetic, hold that same
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Conrad, from the very first, influenced though he was by the French
      novel, showed that Realism alone was not enough for him. That is to say
      that, in presenting the case of Almayer, it was not enough for him merely
      to state as truthfully as possible the facts. Those facts, sordid as they
      are, make the story of Almayer&rsquo;s degradation sufficiently realistic, when
      it is merely <span class="pagenum">111</span><a name="link111" id="link111"></a>recorded
      and perceived by any observer. But upon these recorded facts Conrad&rsquo;s
      imagination, without for a moment deserting the truth, worked,
      beautifying, ennobling it, giving it pity and terror, above all putting it
      mto relation with the whole universe, the whole history of the cycle of
      life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said, the Romantic novel, in its simplest form, was used, very
      often, by writers who wished to escape from the business of the creation
      of character. It had not been used for that purpose by Sir Walter Scott,
      who was, indeed, the first English Romantic-Realist, but it was so used by
      his successors, who found a little optimism, a little adventure, a little
      colour and a little tradition go a long way towards covering the required
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conrad had, from the first, a poet&rsquo;s&mdash;that is to say, a romantic&mdash;mind,
      and his determination to use that romance realistically was simply his
      determination to justify the full play of his romantic mind in the eyes of
      all honest men. <span class="pagenum">112</span><a name="link112"      id="link112"></a>In that intention he has absolutely succeeded; he has not
      abated one jot of his romance&mdash;<i>Nostromo, Lord Jim, Heart of
      Darkness</i> are amongst the most romantic things in all our literature&mdash;but
      the last charge that any critic can make against him is falsification,
      whether of facts, of inference or of consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole history of his development has for its key-stone this
      determination to save his romance by his reality, to extend his reality by
      his romance. He found in English fiction little that could assist him in
      this development; the Russian novelists were to supply him with his clue.
      This whole question of Russian influence is difficult to define, but that
      Conrad has been influenced by Turgéniev a little and by Dostoievsky very
      considerably, cannot be denied. <i>Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The
      Possessed, The Brothers Karamazov</i> are romantic realism at the most
      astonishing heights that this development of the novel is ever likely to
      attain. We will never see again heroes of the Prince Myshkin, Dmitri
      Karamazov, <span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a>Nicolas
      Stavrogin build, men so real to us that no change of time or place, age or
      sickness can take them from us, men so beautifully lit with the romantic
      passion of Dostoievsky&rsquo;s love of humanity that they seem to warm the whole
      world, as we know it, with the fire of their charity. That power of
      creating figures typical as well as individual has been denied to Conrad.
      Captain Anthony, Nostromo, Jim do not belong to the whole world, nor do
      they escape the limitations and confinements that their presentation as
      &ldquo;cases&rdquo; involves on them. Moreover, Conrad does not love humanity. He
      feels pity, tenderness, admiration, but love, except for certain of his
      sea heroes, never, and even with his sea heroes it is love built on his
      scorn of the land. Dostoievsky scorned no one and nothing; as relentless
      in his pursuit of the truth as Stendhal or Flaubert, he found humanity, as
      he investigated it, beautiful because of its humanity&mdash;Conrad finds
      humanity pitiable because of its humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless he has been influenced by <span class="pagenum">114</span><a
      name="link114" id="link114"></a>the Russian writer continuously and
      sometimes obviously. In at least one novel, <i>Under Western Eyes</i>, the
      influence has led to imitation. For that reason, perhaps, that novel is
      the least vital of all his books, and we feel as though Dostoievsky had
      given him Razumov to see what he could make of him, and had remained too
      overwhelmingly curious an onlooker to allow independent creation. What,
      however, Conrad has in common with the creator of Raskolnikov is his
      thrilling pursuit of the lives, the hearts, the minutest details of his
      characters. Conrad alone of all English novelists shares this zest with
      the great Russian. Dostoievsky found his romance in his love of his
      fellow-beings, Conrad finds his in his love of beauty, his poet&rsquo;s cry for
      colour, but their realism they find together in the hearts of men&mdash;and
      they find it not as Flaubert, that they make of it a perfect work of art,
      not as Turgéniev, that they may extract from it a flower of poignant
      beauty, not as Tolstoi, that they may, from it, found a gospel&mdash;simply
      they pursue their quest <span class="pagenum">115</span><a name="link115"      id="link115"></a>because the breathless interest of the pursuit is
      stronger than they. They have, both of them, created characters simply
      because characters demanded to be created. We feel that Emma Bovary was
      dragged, painfully, arduously, against all the strength of her
      determination, out of the shades where she was lurking. Myshkin, the
      Karamazovs, and, in their own degree, Nostromo, Almayer, M&rsquo;Whirr, demanded
      that they should be flung upon the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of seizing upon Romance as a means of avoiding character, he has
      triumphantly forced it to aid him in the creation of the lives that,
      through him, demand existence. This may be said to be the great thing that
      Conrad has done for the English novel&mdash;he has brought the zest of
      creation back into it; the French novelists used life to perfect their art&mdash;the
      Russian novelists used art to liberate their passion for life. That at
      this moment in Russia the novel has lost that zest, that the work of
      Kouprin, Artzybashev, Sologub, Merejkovsky, Andreiev, shows exhaustion and
      sterility <span class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116" id="link116"></a>means
      nothing; the stream will soon ran full again. Meanwhile we, in England,
      know once more what it is to feel, in the novel, the power behind the
      novelist, to be ourselves in the grip of a force that is not afraid of
      romance nor ashamed of realism, that cares for life as life and not as a
      means of proving the necessity for form, the danger of too many
      adjectives, the virtues of the divorce laws or the paradise of free love.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      Finally, what will be the effect of the work of Joseph Conrad upon the
      English novel of the future? Does this Romantic-Realism that he has
      provided for us show any signs of influencing that future? I think that it
      does. In the work of all of the more interesting younger English novelists&mdash;in
      the work of Mr E. M. Forster, Mr D. H. Lawrence, Mr J. D. Beresford, Mr W.
      L. George, Mr Frank Swinnerton, Air Gilbert Gannan, Miss Viola Meynell, Mr
      Brett Young&mdash;this influence is to be detected. <span class="pagenum">117</span><a
      name="link117" id="link117"></a>Even with such avowed realists as Mr
      Beresford, Mr George and Mr Swinnerton the realism is of a nature very
      different from the realism of even ten years ago, as can be seen at once
      by comparing so recent a novel as Mr Swinnerton&rsquo;s <i>On the Staircase</i>
      with Mr Arnold Bennett&rsquo;s <i>Sacred and Profane Love</i>, or Mr
      Galsworthy&rsquo;s <i>Man of Property</i>&mdash;and Mr E. M. Forster is a
      romantic-realist of most curious originality, whose <i>Longest Journey</i>
      and <i>Howard&rsquo;s End</i> may possibly provide the historian of English
      literature with dates as important as the publication of <i>Almayer&rsquo;s
      Folly</i> in 1895. The answer to this question does not properly belong to
      this essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, at any rate, certain that neither the old romance nor the old
      realism can return. We have been shown in <i>Nostromo</i> something that
      has the colour of <i>Treasure Island</i> and the reality of <i>New Grub
      Street</i>. If, on the one hand, the pessimists lament that the English
      novel is dead, that everything that can be done has been done, there is,
      surely, on the other hand, some justification for the optimists who
      believe that at few periods in <span class="pagenum">118</span><a
      name="link118" id="link118"></a>English literature has the novel shown
      more signs of a thrilling and original future.
    </p>
    <p>
      For signs of the possible development of Conrad himselt one may glance for
      a moment at his last novel, <i>Victory</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of <i>Chance</i> and the last volume of short stories had
      shown that there was some danger lest romance should divorce him,
      ultimately, from reality. <i>Victory</i>, splendid tale though it is, does
      not entirely reassure us. The theme of the book is the pursuit of almost
      helpless uprightness and innocence by almost helpless evil and malignancy;
      that is to say that the strength and virtue of Heyst and Lena are as
      elemental and independent of human will and effort as the villainy and
      slime of Mr Jones and Ricardo. Conrad has here then returned to his old
      early demonstration that nature is too strong for man and I feel as
      though, in this book, he had intended the whole affair to be blown,
      finally, sky-high by some natural volcanic eruption. He prepares for that
      eruption and when, for some reason or another, that elemental catastrophe
      is pre<span class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119" id="link119"></a>vented
      he consoles himself by strewing the beach of his island with the battered
      corpses of his characters. It is in such a wanton conclusion, following as
      it does immediately upon the finest, strongest and most beautiful thing in
      the whole of Conrad&mdash;the last conversation between Heyst and Lena&mdash;that
      we see this above-mentioned divorce from reality. We see it again in the
      more fantastic characteristics of Mr Jones and Ricardo, in the presence of
      the Orang Outang, and in other smaller and less important effects. At the
      same time his realism, when he pleases, as in the arrival of the boat of
      the thirst maddened trio on the island beach, is as magnificent in its
      austerity and truth as ever it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will he allow his imagination to carry him wildly into fantasy and
      incredibility? He has not, during these last years, exerted the discipline
      and restraint that were once his law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, at the last, when one looks back over twenty years, from the
      <i>Almayer&rsquo;s Folly</i> of 1895 to the <i>Victory</i> of 1915, one <span
      class="pagenum">120</span><a name="link120" id="link120"></a>realises that
      it was, for the English novel, no mean nor insignificant fortune that
      brought the author of those books to our shores to give a fresh impetus to
      the progress of our literature and to enrich our lives with a new world of
      character and high adventure.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
